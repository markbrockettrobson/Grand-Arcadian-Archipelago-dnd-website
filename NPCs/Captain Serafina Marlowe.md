# Captain Serafina "Red Wake" Marlowe

**Faction:** [[The Red Wake]]  
**Role:** Captain, Legendary Pilot, Professional Opportunist

---

## Overview

Captain Serafina Marlowe, known throughout the Inner Sea as the "Red Wake," is a woman who has turned navigating impossible waters into an art form and a profit center. Pirate, privateer, opportunist, expert. She's been called all of these, and she wears each label with the same wry amusement. What matters to Marlowe isn't what people call her, but what they're willing to pay her.

She is the only known living captain to have successfully navigated the Arcadian seas **three times**, each expedition returning with plunder and, more importantly, with detailed knowledge of the treacherous passages, hidden reefs, and navigable routes. This makes her quite possibly the most valuable single individual in the entire flotilla, and she knows it. Her price reflects this.

## Appearance

Captain Marlowe cuts an imposing figure: tall and weathered, with sun-darkened skin and hair that shows equal parts auburn and salt-spray gray. She dresses practically worn leather, sturdy boots, and a long coat that's seen better days. Her most distinctive feature is the intricate tattoo of breaking waves that runs from her left wrist to her shoulder, said to chart the route of her first successful Arcadian crossing.

She moves with the unconscious balance of someone who's spent more time on a swaying deck than solid ground, and speaks with the blunt directness of someone who has no need to impress anyone.

## Personality

Marlowe is refreshingly, brutally honest about her motivations: she's here for profit. While other factions dress their ambitions in moral urgency or diplomatic necessity, Marlowe simply names her price and delivers results. She finds the entire political theater of the flotilla simultaneously amusing and tedious.

She respects competence and despises pretense. [[Admiral Lysandra Korvus]] earns her professional admiration because the Admiral runs an efficient fleet. [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] earns her mild contempt because he could accomplish in two weeks what he stretches into five months of committee meetings - though she's happy to be paid for every one of those unnecessary days.

Marlowe has a sharp wit and a low tolerance for bureaucratic nonsense. She rarely attends Flotilla Council meetings, and when she does, she's been known to walk out mid-session with a cutting remark about "wasting wind on speeches when you could be making headway."

## Role in the Flotilla

Marlowe serves as the flotilla's chief navigational advisor, a position that comes with a council seat and a salary that would make most envy. She openly acknowledges that she's being paid to sit in meetings she doesn't attend and offer advice she gives sparingly.

When she does offer navigational guidance, however, people listen. Her knowledge of Arcadian waters is unmatched, and she's already vetoed two potentially disastrous routes that looked safe on charts she claimed were a disaster waiting to happen.

## Relationships

- **[[Admiral Lysandra Korvus]]**: Mutual professional respect between two women who understand naval operations at the highest level. The Admiral disapproves of Marlowe's mercenary ethics but cannot fault her seamanship. Marlowe appreciates competence when she sees it.

- **[[Bastian Vale]]**: Her first mate and personal bard, responsible for ensuring Captain Marlowe's exploits are properly chronicled and exaggerated in equal measure. Their relationship is equal parts professional necessity and genuine friendship.

- **[[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]]**: Marlowe finds Lord Voss's diplomatic approach exhausting and inefficient, but she respects that he's the one actually holding the fractious coalition together. More importantly, his treasury is the one paying her salary.

- **[[The Hands of the Everlight]]**: They view her as everything wrong with the expedition. She views them as naive idealists who would have gotten their entire mercy mission sunk in the Widow's Teeth without expert pilots. Neither opinion is likely to change.
