## Appearance

Lord Voss is a distinguished man in his late sixties, with steel-grey hair meticulously styled and a neatly trimmed beard showing only the slightest hints of its former black. He stands tall despite his years, his posture a testament to decades of formal court proceedings and diplomatic functions. His eyes are a piercing amber, sharp and calculating, missing nothing in any negotiation.

He dresses in the formal regalia befitting both his station as a high cleric of Abadar and his role as one of Absalom's premier diplomats: immaculate robes of deep blue and gold, adorned with the key symbol of Abadar worked in thread-of-gold. A heavy golden chain of office rests across his shoulders, each link inscribed with a different commercial treaty he has personally negotiated. He carries a ceremonial scepter topped with Abadar's scales, though those who have seen him in true danger know the instrument functions as a far more than mere symbol.

Despite spending months at sea, Lord Voss maintains an almost supernatural level of grooming and presentation his robes never wrinkled, his appearance never disheveled. Some suspect minor divine magic; others attribute it to an almost pathological need for order.

## Personality

Lord Voss is a study in controlled intensity. In negotiation, he is patient, methodical, and relentlessly reasonable, capable of spending twelve hours debating a single clause without losing his composure. He has an almost supernatural ability to read people, to understand what they truly want beneath what they _say_ they want, and to find the exact compromise that gives everyone just enough to accept without anyone getting everything they desire.

He speaks in the measured tones of someone accustomed to having his words recorded for posterity, choosing each phrase with care. When he raises his voice, it is a calculated decision designed for maximum effect and those who have witnessed his rare displays of controlled anger describe them as far more terrifying than any screaming tantrum.

His charisma is undeniable but of a particular flavor: he does not inspire passionate loyalty or fiery devotion, but rather a sense of competence, security, and inevitable progress. People trust him not because they love him, but because he has never failed to deliver exactly what he promised, when he promised it, to the exact specifications agreed upon.

However, beneath the diplomatic veneer lies a man driven by genuine idealism, even if it is the cold pragmatic idealism of someone who has seen empires fall to chaos and wants desperately to build something that will _last_. He genuinely believes that law, order, and proper procedure are the highest forms of mercy, that a well-written treaty saves more lives than a hundred acts of individual charity.
