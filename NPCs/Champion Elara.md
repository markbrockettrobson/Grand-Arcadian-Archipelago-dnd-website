# Champion Elara

**Ancestry:** Human  
**Class/Profession:** Champion of Sarenrae
**Faction:** [[The Hands of the Everlight]]

---

## Appearance

A powerfully built woman in her early thirties with dark skin, close-cropped black hair, and a warrior's bearing softened by compassionate eyes. She typically wears gleaming scale mail emblazoned with Sarenrae's holy symbol, with a scimitar at her hip and a shield on her back—both showing signs of regular use and meticulous care.

## Unlike many champions who appear intimidating, Elara has a warm, reassuring presence.

## Personality

Elara embodies the challenging balance between Sarenrae's mercy and her wrath. She is a devoted protector, a skilled warrior, and a deeply patient individual who must constantly reconcile her own feelings with her duty.

She **agrees with Valerius's anger** the delays were morally inexcusable, and the profiteering disgusts her. Her warrior's heart burns with the same righteous fury. However, she **respects Kaelen's methods**, recognizing that pragmatism and diplomacy are weapons too, just wielded differently.

This makes her the natural bridge between the faction's idealist leader and its pragmatic diplomat. She can translate between their worldviews because she genuinely holds both in her own heart.

Her primary frustration is her "impossible job" protecting a pacifist leader who actively refuses to stay out of danger. Valerius will walk into the most hostile political situations unarmed except for her moral conviction, and Elara must be prepared to defend her without being able to counsel caution effectively.
