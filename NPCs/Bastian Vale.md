**Role:** First Mate, Bard, Professional Chronicler
**Ancestry:** Halfling

## Overview

Bastian Vale serves as first mate aboard _The Red Wake_. His primary responsibility is simple: chronicle Captain [[Captain Serafina Marlowe|Serafina Marlowe]]'s exploits and ensure that every tavern, noble court, and sailor's gathering from Absalom to the Shackles knows exactly who piloted through the Arcadian seas and lived to boast about it.

To outsiders, especially the more serious-minded members of the [[The Assembly of Accord|Assembly of Accord]], this seems absurd, hiring a bard as first mate solely to write songs about the captain. To Captain Marlowe, it's essential business strategy. Reputation commands higher fees, and Bastian is very, very good at building reputations.
