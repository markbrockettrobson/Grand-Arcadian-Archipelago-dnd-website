**Ancestry:** Human  
**Class/Profession:** Cleric of Sarenrae  
**Faction:** [[The Hands of the Everlight]]

---

## Appearance

A woman in her late forties with sun-weathered skin and intense, burning eyes that reflect her unwavering conviction. She wears the traditional white and gold vestments of Sarenrae's clergy, though they're often stained with the evidence of her tireless healing work. Her auburn hair is streaked with early gray, pulled back tightly in a practical bun. A golden sun medallion hangs prominently at her chest, and her hands bear the calluses of both prayer and medical practice.

## Personality

Valerius is a force of moral fury barely contained within a healer's frame. She is a **radical pacifist** who refuses to participate in violence herself, yet her words carry the weight of righteous anger that can silence a room. She has no patience for diplomatic niceties or "polite" language she speaks the raw truth as she sees it, regardless of who it offends.

Her anger stems not from cruelty but from compassion pushed beyond its breaking point. Every delay, every bureaucratic meeting, every merchant ship "stealing the wind" represents lives lost in her eyes. She views the five-month delay before departure as a moral catastrophe that she will never forgive.

Despite her fierce temperament, she is genuinely caring toward those suffering and shows infinite patience with the sick and injured. Her fury is reserved entirely for those she views as complicit in unnecessary suffering.
