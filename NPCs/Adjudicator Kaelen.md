# Adjudicator Kaelen

**Ancestry:** Half-Elf  
**Class/Profession:** Cleric of Sarenrae / Diplomat
**Faction:** [[The Hands of the Everlight]]

## Appearance

A slender half-elf in his thirties with elegant features and kind, patient eyes. Kaelen dresses in the white and gold of Sarenrae's clergy, but his vestments are always immaculate and carefully maintained—a stark contrast to Valerius's work-stained robes. He has dark hair kept neat and professional, His hands and words are soft compared to Valerius's calloused ones, though they're equally capable of channeling healing magic.

## Personality

Kaelen is the calm after Valerius's storm. He possesses the patience and diplomatic grace that his superior lacks. Where Valerius burns with righteous fury, Kaelen is steady, pragmatic determination.

He understands and even shares Valerius's moral anger—the delays were unconscionable, and the profiteering is disgusting. However, he also recognizes the hard truth: without the "bloated flotilla" and all its political baggage, they would have no ships, no supplies, and no way to actually reach those who need help.

Kaelen is a masterful diplomat, skilled at reframing Valerius's confrontational statements as "passionate concern" and her accusations as "valid points worth considering." He walks into rooms five minutes after she's stormed out, offering apologies and turning bridges she's burned into merely scorched but salvageable relationships.

Despite his diplomatic nature, he is not weak or obsequious. He genuinely believes in working within systems to achieve goals, even if those systems are flawed.
