**Ancestry:** Human  
**Class/Profession:** Fighter (Naval Commander)
**Faction:** [[The Assembly of Accord]]

## Appearance

Admiral Korvus is a woman in her early fifties with the weathered complexion of someone who has spent decades at sea. Her dark brown hair is cut practically short, streaked with grey at the temples, and she carries herself with the absolute confidence of a master of her domain. Her eyes are a sharp grey-blue, constantly scanning, assessing, calculating distances and angles even in casual conversation.

She wears the formal naval uniform of Absalom's fleet: deep blue coat with gold epaulettes bearing her rank, polished brass buttons, and white gloves that she removes only when actually working the rigging or handling charts. A ceremonial cutlass hangs at her hip, though her true weapon a bastard sword rests within easy reach in her cabin.

Unlike [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]]'s immaculate presentation, Korvus has a lived-in appearance her uniform shows the careful repairs of long use at sea, her hands are calloused from actual work, and there's often a smudge of ink on her fingers from marking charts.

## Personality

Admiral Korvus is a consummate professional with little patience for politics or diplomatic niceties. She views the world through the lens of logistics, capabilities, and practical outcomes. When [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] speaks in soaring rhetoric about civilization and legacy, Korvus translates it into tonnage, crew rotations, supply lines, and nautical miles.

She is direct, sometimes bluntly so, and has earned a reputation for telling uncomfortable truths that others would prefer to avoid. During Flotilla Council meetings, she is the one who points out that a proposed plan requires resources that don't exist, or that a diplomatic solution won't matter if the fleet can't actually reach the destination.

**Quirks:**

- Unconsciously uses nautical metaphors for everything ("We're in uncharted waters," "That plan won't hold water," "Dead reckoning won't work here")
- Keeps a small brass sextant on her desk that she fidgets with during tedious meetings
- Cannot sleep in a bed that doesn't move with the waves; had her quarters specially designed to simulate ship motion
- Maintains a personal log of every day's weather, wind conditions, and distance traveled

## Relationship to Party

Admiral Korvus judges people by a simple metric: can they follow orders and get the job done? She has little interest in backstory, personality, or charm she wants to know if you can complete your mission and return with accurate intelligence.

## Role in the Assembly

Admiral Korvus commands Absalom's naval contribution to the expedition: three of the finest ships in the Inner Sea.

- **The Concordance** (Flagship): A state-of-the-art warship built to the latest Absalom specifications, serving as her command vessel and the mobile headquarters for fleet operations
- **The Golden Key**: A heavily armed merchant-warship hybrid, carrying both valuable cargo and the firepower to protect it
- **The First Accord**: A fast frigate used for scouting, communication, and rapid response

Beyond the three Absalom vessels, she holds operational command over fleet movements and navigation for the entire flotilla a responsibility given grudgingly by other factions but one she has proven invaluable in executing.

Her relationship with [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] appears to be one of mutual respect and complementary skills. They meet each morning to coordinate the day's plans observers note that he handles the politics while she handles the logistics, and together they keep the unwieldy flotilla moving forward.

She has been observed treating [[Adjudicator Kaelen]] of [[The Hands of the Everlight|the Hands of the Everlight]] with professional respect, possibly recognizing a fellow pragmatist trying to manage idealists. Her interactions with [[High Healer Valerius]] are more visibly strained while she maintains formal courtesy, her body language and clipped responses suggest frustration. She has stated publicly that "without proper planning, we'd lose half the fleet to storms and reefs before ever reaching Arcadia," a comment clearly directed at critics of the expedition's preparation time.

Her relationship with [[Captain Serafina Marlowe]] is perhaps her most complicated professional connection. Korvus's distaste for Marlowe's mercenary ethics and flagrant disregard for council protocol is barely concealed. However, she has acknowledged publicly that Marlowe's three successful crossings represent "considerable seamanship and navigational skill." The two maintain professional courtesy when fleet operations require coordination between their vessels, though they clearly will never be friends.
