## Appearance

Lord Voss is a distinguished man in his late sixties, with steel-grey hair meticulously styled and a neatly trimmed beard showing only the slightest hints of its former black. He stands tall despite his years, his posture a testament to decades of formal court proceedings and diplomatic functions. His eyes are a piercing amber, sharp and calculating, missing nothing in any negotiation.

He dresses in the formal regalia befitting both his station as a high cleric of Abadar and his role as one of Absalom's premier diplomats: immaculate robes of deep blue and gold, adorned with the key symbol of Abadar worked in thread-of-gold. A heavy golden chain of office rests across his shoulders, each link inscribed with a different commercial treaty he has personally negotiated. He carries a ceremonial scepter topped with Abadar's scales, though those who have seen him in true danger know the instrument functions as a far more than mere symbol.

Despite spending months at sea, Lord Voss maintains an almost supernatural level of grooming and presentation his robes never wrinkled, his appearance never disheveled. Some suspect minor divine magic; others attribute it to an almost pathological need for order.

## Personality

Lord Voss presents as a study in controlled intensity. In negotiation, he demonstrates remarkable patience and methodical reasoning, capable of spending twelve hours debating a single clause without visible loss of composure. He has shown a consistent ability to broker compromises that give each faction just enough to accept without anyone getting everything they desire a skill some attribute to careful study of those he negotiates with.

He speaks in measured tones, choosing each phrase with obvious care, as though aware his words may be recorded for posterity. On the rare occasions when he raises his voice, the effect is striking those who have witnessed these controlled displays of anger describe them as far more impactful than any shouting match.

His charisma is undeniable but of a particular flavor: he does not inspire passionate loyalty or fiery devotion, but rather conveys competence, security, and a sense of inevitable progress. People appear to trust him not out of personal affection, but because he has consistently delivered what he promised, when he promised it, to the exact specifications agreed upon.

His public speeches emphasize that proper procedure and lawful frameworks are "the highest forms of mercy," arguing that well-written treaties save more lives than individual acts of charity. Whether this represents genuine idealism or sophisticated rhetoric to justify Absalom's control remains a matter of debate among those who work with him. Some who have served with Voss for years believe he truly is driven by a vision of building lasting institutions; others suspect his idealism conveniently aligns with Absalom's interests.
