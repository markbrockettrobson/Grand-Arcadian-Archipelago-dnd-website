## Appearance

Magister Vael is a man in his mid-forties with the distinctive features of old Azlanti bloodline pale skin, angular features, and striking violet eyes that seem to gleam with arcane energy. His hair, once jet black, is now liberally streaked with premature white, which he attributes to "too many close encounters with magical backlash."

He dresses in the formal regalia of Absalom's Arcanamirium: deep purple robes embroidered with silver runic patterns, a golden chain bearing the seal of the Acting First Spell Lord, and an extensive collection of rings, amulets, and other magical accoutrements. Unlike many wizards who cultivate an air of otherworldly mystery, Vael maintains a crisp, professional appearance his robes are always immaculate, his spell component pouch meticulously organized, and his spellbook protected by no fewer than seven different preservation enchantments.

He carries an ornate staff of dark wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl in patterns resembling ancient Azlanti runes though whether these are genuine artifacts or merely decorative replicas is a subject of much speculation.

## Personality

Magister Vael embodies the scholarly approach to magic methodical, precise, and intensely curious. He treats magical research with the same reverence that [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] treats legal contracts: every variable must be documented, every experiment reproducible, every conclusion supported by rigorous evidence.

In conversation, he tends toward academic formality, liberally peppering his speech with citations, references to obscure texts, and careful qualifications ("As Zephus the Younger noted in his third treatise on planar resonance, though his methodology was admittedly questionable..."). This can make him seem pedantic, but those who look past the academic affectations find a genuinely passionate scholar who believes that proper understanding of magic can solve problems that raw power cannot.

His interest in lost Azlanti ruins is both professional and apparently deeply personal. As someone who carries visible Azlanti blood (albeit heavily diluted by millennia), he has publicly stated that recovering ancient knowledge is "reclaiming a heritage" rather than mere archaeological plundering. This perspective differentiates him from scholars who approach such sites with purely academic interest.

Unlike some of Absalom's more conservative wizards, Vael appears pragmatic about magical ethics. He has argued in council discussions that "knowledge itself is neutral it's the application that carries moral weight." This position has led to observable tension with more cautious colleagues who advocate that some knowledge should remain buried.

## Role in the Assembly

Magister Vael serves as the Assembly of Accord's chief magical advisor and the official representative of Absalom's Arcanamirium. His responsibilities include:

- **Magical Defense:** Coordinating protective enchantments across the fleet
- **Navigation Support:** Using divination magic to supplement mundane navigation
- **Artifact Analysis:** Examining any magical items recovered during the expedition
- **Runic Research:** Documenting and analyzing any ancient inscriptions encountered
- **Diplomatic Magic:** Providing magical authentication for treaties and contracts

He works closely with both [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] and [[Admiral Lysandra Korvus]]. With Lord Voss, he shares an appreciation for proper documentation and rigorous methodology observers note their meetings often run long as they debate the finer points of procedure and evidence. With Admiral Korvus, the relationship appears more strained she visibly grows impatient with his lengthy explanations, occasionally cutting him off with requests for "the practical summary." Vael's carefully hidden frustration at these interruptions sometimes shows in subtle tightening around his eyes.

His relationship with [[The Hands of the Everlight]] is professionally cordial. He has provided healing-enhancement enchantments for their medical supplies and helped establish preservation spells for their medicine stores. [[High Healer Valerius]] appreciates his practical assistance even if she has no interest in his scholarly pursuits.

However, Vael has made enemies among other factions' wizards who resent Absalom's claim of primacy in magical matters. Several rival researchers from other nations eye the same ruins he hopes to study, and the race to be first could turn ugly.
