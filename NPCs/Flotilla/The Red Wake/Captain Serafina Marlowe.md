# Captain Serafina "Red Wake" Marlowe

![[../../../../Artwork/NPC/Captain Serafina Marlowe.png]]

**Faction:** [[The Red Wake]]  
**Role:** Captain, Legendary Pilot, Professional Opportunist

---

## Overview

Captain Serafina Marlowe, known throughout the Inner Sea as the "Red Wake," is a woman who has turned navigating impossible waters into an art form and a profit center. Pirate, privateer, opportunist, expert. She's been called all of these, and she wears each label with the same wry amusement. What matters to Marlowe isn't what people call her, but what they're willing to pay her.

She is the only known living captain to have successfully navigated the Arcadian seas **three times**, each expedition returning with plunder and, more importantly, with detailed knowledge of the treacherous passages, hidden reefs, and navigable routes. This makes her quite possibly the most valuable single individual in the entire flotilla a fact she appears well aware of, if her negotiating position is any indication. Her compensation from the Assembly reflects this reality.

## Appearance

Captain Marlowe cuts an imposing figure: tall and weathered, with sun-darkened skin and hair that shows equal parts auburn and salt-spray gray. She dresses practically worn leather, sturdy boots, and a long coat that's seen better days. Her most distinctive feature is the intricate tattoo of breaking waves that runs from her left wrist to her shoulder, said to chart the route of her first successful Arcadian crossing.

She moves with the unconscious balance of someone who's spent more time on a swaying deck than solid ground, and speaks with the blunt directness of someone who has no need to impress anyone.

## Personality

Marlowe is refreshingly, brutally honest about her motivations in public: she's here for profit. While other factions dress their ambitions in moral urgency or diplomatic necessity, Marlowe simply names her price and delivers results. She treats the entire political theater of the flotilla with visible amusement and occasional tedium.

Her public comments suggest she respects competence and despises pretense. She has spoken positively of [[Admiral Lysandra Korvus]] as someone who "actually runs a fleet instead of talking about running one." Her commentary about [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] is more cutting she's remarked that "she could accomplish in two weeks what he stretches into five months of committee meetings" though she's also noted she's "happy to be paid for every one of those unnecessary days."

Marlowe has a sharp wit and demonstrably low tolerance for bureaucratic nonsense. She rarely attends Flotilla Council meetings, and when she does, she's been known to walk out mid-session with cutting remarks about "wasting wind on speeches when you could be making headway."

## Role in the Flotilla

Marlowe serves as the flotilla's chief navigational advisor, a position that comes with a council seat and a salary that would make most envy. She openly acknowledges that she's being paid to sit in meetings she doesn't attend and offer advice she gives sparingly.

When she does offer navigational guidance, however, people listen. Her knowledge of Arcadian waters is unmatched, and she's already vetoed two potentially disastrous routes that looked safe on charts she claimed were a disaster waiting to happen.

## Relationships

- **[[Admiral Lysandra Korvus]]**: The two maintain professional respect despite clear differences in ethics. The Admiral's disapproval of Marlowe's mercenary approach is barely concealed, but she has publicly acknowledged Marlowe's seamanship. Marlowe, for her part, has made favorable comments about the Admiral's competence in naval operations.

- **[[Bastian Vale]]**: Her first mate and personal bard, responsible for chronicling Captain Marlowe's exploits. Their interactions suggest a relationship that goes beyond mere professional necessity they appear to genuinely enjoy each other's company.

- **[[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]]**: Marlowe's public comments about Lord Voss's diplomatic approach are frequently disparaging, though she has acknowledged he's "the one actually holding the fractious coalition together." More pragmatically, she's aware his treasury is the source of her considerable salary.

- **[[The Hands of the Everlight]]**: The healers have publicly denounced her as representing everything wrong with the expedition profit-seeking amid humanitarian crisis. Marlowe has been overheard remarking that "naive idealists would have gotten their entire mercy mission sunk in the Widow's Teeth without expert pilots." Neither faction shows signs of improving their opinion of the other.
