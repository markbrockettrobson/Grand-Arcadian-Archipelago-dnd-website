## Appearance

Armiger-Magistrate Corvain Thorn cuts an imposing figure even when not in his Hellknight plate. In his mid-forties, he possesses the bearing of a man who has spent decades enforcing compliance through presence alone. His jawline looks carved from granite. His eyes are a cold slate grey, and they assess every person he meets with the methodical attention of someone trained to identify weakness and exploit it.

His dark hair is cut military-short, showing threads of premature silver at the temples. A thin scar runs from his left eyebrow to his hairline a reminder of an early case where a fugitive chose resistance over surrender. The fugitive did not survive the lesson.

## Personality

Corvain Thorn presents as a man of absolute conviction in the righteousness of law and procedure. In council meetings, he speaks in the clipped, precise language of legal documents, citing specific clauses and subsections with practiced ease. He has never been observed to compromise on a matter of procedure, insisting that ambiguous laws must be "clarified" through lengthy debate until no ambiguity remains.

Those who have interacted with Thorn describe him as deeply unsettling to negotiate with. He maintains unwavering eye contact during conversations, never showing visible emotion beyond occasional tightness around the mouth when others propose "flexible interpretations" of established rules. He has no detectable sense of humor several factions have attempted jokes to lighten tense council sessions, and Thorn has responded to each with silence or requests to "return to the agenda."

When [[High Healer Valerius]] accused him of "letting children die for the sake of paperwork," Thorn's response was chillingly clinical: _"Better a hundred die today under legitimate authority than ten thousand die tomorrow in a war over who has the right to govern their survivors."_ This statement has become infamous among the flotilla, interpreted by some as pragmatic if brutal realism, and by others as evidence of moral bankruptcy.

Thorn appears genuinely unmoved by emotional appeals. Arguments grounded in compassion, urgency, or humanitarian necessity visibly fail to affect him. He responds to such appeals by redirecting to matters of procedure and legal precedent, as though the emotional content was simply irrelevant noise to be filtered out.

Interestingly, Thorn shows no signs of personal ambition or desire for glory. He has never advocated for policies that would personally benefit him, and seems entirely focused on establishing what he calls "proper order," regardless of who ultimately benefits. When others call him rigid, he has been heard to reply, _"Consistency is not rigidity. It is reliability."_

## Role in the Expedition

Thorn serves as the public face of [[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority]], representing Chelish interests in the Flotilla Council and coordinating their legal and diplomatic efforts. While the Chelish delegation includes contract lawyers and legal scholars who handle the detailed work of filing objections and parsing treaty language, Thorn provides visible authority and gravitas to their positions.

When Thorn stands before the Council and announces that the Chelish delegation has "significant procedural concerns" about a proposed action, the Hellknight armor-clad representatives standing behind him make clear this is not merely academic debate. His presentations are methodical and comprehensive, often citing specific clauses from the Charter of Shared Waters, relevant maritime law precedents, and potential long-term consequences of "hasty action."

The pattern is consistent: whenever the coalition attempts to move forward with an initiative, Thorn identifies procedural requirements that have not been met. Proposed workarounds are met with references to specific clauses that forbid such "creative interpretations." Whether this represents genuine commitment to legal order or calculated obstruction remains a matter of debate among other factions.

[[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] has grown visibly frustrated with Thorn's presentations, though he rarely directly challenges them the uncomfortable reality being that Thorn is always technically correct in his citations. The legal frameworks Voss built appear to have given the Chelish delegation significant leverage to slow decision-making, intentionally or otherwise.

## Observed Interactions with Other Factions

**[[The Assembly of Accord]]**: Thorn and [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] share a common language of legal procedure and often vote together on matters of protocol. Their public interactions are formally cordial, though Voss's frustration has become increasingly visible in recent council meetings. They have co-sponsored several provisions in the Charter of Shared Waters, suggesting some level of cooperation, though the extent to which Thorn's procedural objections genuinely align with Voss's vision remains unclear.

**[[The Hands of the Everlight]]**: The relationship between Thorn and the healers is openly hostile. When [[High Healer Valerius]] accused him of valuing paperwork over lives, his response was cold and clinical, prioritizing "long-term stability" over immediate humanitarian action. The healers have largely stopped attempting to appeal to Thorn's sense of compassion, apparently concluding either that he lacks one or that it is buried too deep beneath legalistic thinking to access. Thorn, for his part, treats their emotional appeals with visible indifference, consistently redirecting conversations to procedural matters.

**[[The Red Wake]]**: Thorn's interactions with [[Captain Serafina Marlowe]] are minimal and professional. He has been observed instructing Chelish staff to coordinate with her on navigational matters without unnecessary antagonism, suggesting he recognizes her expertise as valuable despite apparent distaste for her mercenary ethics. Marlowe seems to find his legalistic approach amusing more than threatening.

**[[Admiral Lysandra Korvus]]**: Thorn and the Admiral maintain professional courtesy despite apparent philosophical differences about operational decision-making. They share respect for discipline and hierarchy, though she clearly prefers decisive action where he insists on thorough procedural review. Their interactions are formal but functional when coalition operations require coordination between Chelish and Absalom naval assets.
