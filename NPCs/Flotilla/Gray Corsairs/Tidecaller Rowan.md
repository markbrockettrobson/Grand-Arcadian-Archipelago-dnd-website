![[../../../../Artwork/NPC/Tidecaller-Rowan.png]]

**Tidecaller Rowan** is a powerful druid affiliated with [[The Gray Corsairs]], whose command over wind, wave, and weather has become one of the flotilla's most valuable assets. Unlike the fiery passion of [[NPCs/Flotilla/Gray Corsairs/Captain Isla Stormwright|Captain Isla Stormwright]], Rowan brings a quiet, contemplative presence a calm at the center of the storm.

## Appearance and Demeanor

Rowan presents an androgynous appearance, with weather-worn features that make age difficult to determine anywhere from thirty to sixty winters. Their skin is deeply tanned and marked with tattoos that seem to shift like waves in certain light simple observer's tricks, rather than actual magic, though many aren't entirely sure. They dress in practical sailing clothes layered with shells, feathers, and small fetishes that clatter softly when they move.

Most striking are Rowan's eyes a pale gray-blue that matches the sea before a storm. When reading the weather or working weather magic, their gaze becomes distant, as if looking through the present moment to see the patterns of wind and water that lie beneath visible reality.

Rowan speaks rarely, and when they do, it is with the slow deliberation of someone who measures their words as carefully as a navigator measures depth. They seem more comfortable with the language of wind and wave than the language of politics.

## The Weather Reader

Rowan's reputation as a weather caller is well-earned and widely known throughout the flotilla. They possess an almost supernatural ability to read approaching weather patterns, often predicting storms or calm waters days before they arrive. More impressively, they can summon favorable winds to speed travel, calm dangerous seas to ease passage, or part forming storms around vessels under threat.

Many throughout the flotilla have witnessed Rowan's magic. The mysterious favorable winds that seem to fill Gray Corsair sails when urgent travel is needed and the tropical storm that split around the flotilla, leaving the fleet in an island of calm while destruction raged mere miles away on all sides.

Rowan never boasts of these accomplishments and rarely discusses the specifics of their druidic abilities. When questioned about particularly impressive displays of weather magic, they tend to respond with enigmatic statements like "the wind was already willing" or "the sea remembers the old words."

## Service to the Flotilla

One of the most remarkable aspects of Rowan's service is their generosity. Despite being affiliated with [[The Gray Corsairs]], Rowan offers their weather reading and magical assistance to any vessel in need, regardless of factional allegiance. They have guided [[The Assembly of Accord]]'s flagship through dangerous currents and even warned [[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority]]'s ships about approaching storms despite the deep tensions between Cheliax and the Corsairs.

This impartiality has earned Rowan respect even from those who view [[The Gray Corsairs]] with suspicion. It's difficult to maintain hostility toward someone who recently saved your ship from a hurricane. Many suspect that Rowan's quiet diplomacy through service has done more to build goodwill for the Gray Corsairs than all of Captain Isla's passionate speeches combined.

When asked why they offer assistance so freely, even to factions whose goals they might oppose, Rowan's answer is consistent: "The sea does not choose sides. Neither do I. The wind blows where it will, and so do I offer aid where it is needed."

## Philosophy: The Living Archipelago

Rowan views the Arcadian Archipelago not as territory to be claimed or resources to be exploited, but as a living ecosystem that must be respected and understood. They have expressed concern in council meetings that the factions are so focused on political maneuvering that they fail to recognize the islands themselves as active participants in what unfolds.

> _"You speak of establishing ports, claiming territories, writing treaties. But have you asked the islands what they want? Have you listened to the voice of the jungle, the whisper of the coral, the warning in the change of tide? This land is not empty parchment waiting for your signatures. It is alive, ancient, and aware. Approach it with respect, or you will learn that the greatest power here does not sail on your ships."_ **Tidecaller Rowan**, to the Flotilla Council.

These warnings have been noted but not fully understood by most of the expedition's leadership. Some dismiss them as druidic mysticism, others as poetic metaphor. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Magister Tertius Vael|Magister Tertius Vael]] has expressed particular interest in Rowan's observations, noting that ancient Azlanti texts sometimes mentioned "living lands" and "earth that watches," though he interprets this as probably referencing ley lines and residual magical effects rather than literal consciousness.

## Relationship with the Gray Corsairs

Rowan's alliance with [[The Gray Corsairs]] seems based on shared values rather than political alignment. They appreciate the Corsairs' commitment to freedom and their opposition to exploitation of both people and nature. Captain Isla Stormwright has stated publicly that Rowan is not under her command, but rather "a free spirit who sails with us by choice, not duty."

The relationship appears to be one of mutual respect. Isla provides Rowan the protection of the Corsairs' ships and the platform to pursue their weather magic in service of the flotilla. Rowan, in turn, ensures the Gray Corsairs' vessels are never caught unprepared by weather and can respond quickly when their principles demand action.

There are whispers that Rowan's presence is one of the main reasons [[The Assembly of Accord]] tolerates the Gray Corsairs' confrontational approach to Cheliax losing access to the fleet's most skilled weather reader would be a strategic mistake.
