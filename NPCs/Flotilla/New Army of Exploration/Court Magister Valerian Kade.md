## Personality

Kade is brilliant, obsessive, and ethically flexible when it comes to acquiring magical knowledge. He views the Arcadian Archipelago as the greatest archaeological opportunity of the century, a treasure trove of pre-Earthfall [Azlanti](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Azlant) wonders waiting to be claimed and studied. He speaks of "preserving knowledge for posterity" and "ensuring humanity's magical heritage isn't lost to time," but his actions suggest he's more interested in ensuring _Taldor's_ magical supremacy.

His rivalry with [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Magister Tertius Vael|Magister Tertius Vael]] of [[The Assembly of Accord]] is an open secret. Both are specialists in Azlanti magic and history. Both view themselves as the preeminent expert on ancient arcane civilization. Both are racing to be the first to unlock the archipelago's magical secrets. Neither has any intention of sharing credit.

The rivalry has produced several tense council moments, including one memorable exchange where Kade questioned the "academic rigor" of Vael's research methodology, and Vael responded by noting that "rigorous academics publish their findings rather than hoarding them." [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Arbitrator Voss]] had to call a recess.

Kade pays lip service to [[NPCs/Surveyor-General Octavia Rhen|Surveyor-General Rhen's]] ethical guidelines while clearly viewing them as obstacles. He has been heard muttering that "preservation of knowledge transcends modern political sensitivities" and that "the Azlanti would want their legacy studied by those capable of understanding it."

## Role in the Expedition

As chief arcane researcher, Kade leads the delegation's magical specialists, archaeologists, and historians. The _Azlanti's Echo_, outfitted as a floating research library and arcane laboratory, serves as his base of operations. His team includes several skilled wizards and a surprising number of scholars who seem more interested in ancient ruins than humanitarian relief.

Kade's stated goal is to catalog Azlanti sites, preserve magical artifacts, and unlock the archipelago's arcane secrets for the benefit of scholarly understanding. His actual goal appears to be ensuring that Taldor controls access to the most powerful magical discoveries, granting the empire strategic advantage in future conflicts.

He has proposed numerous "brief detours" to investigate reported ruins, magical anomalies, and sites of historical significance. [[NPCs/Surveyor-General Octavia Rhen|Rhen]] has vetoed most of these, leading to visible tension within the delegation. When Rhen's not looking, Kade has been known to offer private information exchanges with other factions willing to assist his research.

## Observed Interactions with Other Factions

**[[The Assembly of Accord]]:** Kade's relationship with the Assembly is defined entirely by his bitter rivalry with [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Magister Tertius Vael|Magister Tertius Vael]]. They avoid each other when possible. When forced to interact, they engage in elaborate academic passive-aggression, questioning each other's citations, methodologies, and interpretations. This makes [[NPCs/Surveyor-General Octavia Rhen|Rhen's]] attempts to maintain good relations with the Assembly significantly more difficult.

**[[The Red Wake]]:** Kade views [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Marlowe]] as a potential source of information about Azlanti sites she encountered during previous voyages. He has attempted to negotiate private information exchanges, offering payment or access to Taldan research in exchange for details about ruins she's seen. Marlowe appears amused by these overtures and has been playing him for better compensation.

**[[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority]]:** Kade shows little interest in the Chelish beyond professional courtesy.

**[[The Hands of the Everlight]]:** Kade has minimal interaction with [[The Hands of the Everlight]]. When pressed to justify archaeological research during a humanitarian crisis, he argues that "understanding the magical environment is essential for safely deploying healing magic." The Hands are not convinced.

> _"Perhaps if Magister Vael spent less time politicking and more time studying actual pre-Earthfall texts, his theories wouldn't rely so heavily on... creative interpretation."_
