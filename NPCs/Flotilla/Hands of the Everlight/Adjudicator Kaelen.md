![[Adjudicator-Kaelen.png]]

**Ancestry:** Half-Elf  
**Class/Profession:** Cleric of Sarenrae / Diplomat
**Faction:** [[The Hands of the Everlight]]

## Appearance

A slender half-elf in his thirties with elegant features and kind, patient eyes. Kaelen dresses in the white and gold of Sarenrae's clergy, but his vestments are always immaculate and carefully maintained - a stark contrast to Valerius's work-stained robes. He has dark hair kept neat and professional, His hands and words are soft compared to Valerius's calloused ones, though they're equally capable of channeling healing magic.

## Personality

Kaelen presents as the calm after Valerius's storm. He demonstrates the patience and diplomatic grace that his superior conspicuously lacks. Where Valerius burns with righteous fury, Kaelen offers steady, pragmatic engagement.

While he has never publicly contradicted Valerius's moral arguments about the delays being unconscionable or the profiteering being disgusting, his approach to addressing these concerns differs dramatically. In council meetings and private conversations, he acknowledges the validity of her anger while also noting the practical reality: without the "bloated flotilla" and all its political complications, The Hands would have no ships, no supplies, and no way to actually reach those who need help.

Kaelen has proven himself a masterful diplomat, skilled at reframing Valerius's confrontational statements as "passionate concern" and her accusations as "valid points worth considering." He is frequently observed walking into rooms five minutes after she's stormed out, offering apologies and mending relationships she's damaged. His ability to salvage bridges Valerius burns has become something of a running pattern in the flotilla.

Despite his diplomatic nature, he is not weak or merely obsequious. When pressed, he defends The Hands' positions firmly, and his arguments for working within established systems to achieve goals appear to reflect genuine conviction rather than mere political expedience.
