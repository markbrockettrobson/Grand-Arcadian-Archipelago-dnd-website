## Appearance

A woman in her late forties with sun-weathered skin and intense, burning eyes that reflect her unwavering conviction. She wears the traditional white and gold vestments of Sarenrae's clergy, though they're often stained with the evidence of her tireless healing work. Her auburn hair is streaked with early gray, pulled back tightly in a practical bun. A golden sun medallion hangs prominently at her chest, and her hands bear the calluses of both prayer and medical practice.

## Personality

Valerius is a force of moral fury barely contained within a healer's frame. She is a **radical pacifist** who refuses to participate in violence herself, yet her words carry the weight of righteous anger that can silence a room. She has no patience for diplomatic niceties or "polite" language she speaks the raw truth as she sees it, regardless of who it offends.

She has publicly and repeatedly stated that every delay, every bureaucratic meeting, every merchant ship "stealing the wind" represents lives lost. She has declared the five-month delay before departure a "moral catastrophe" that she holds the Assembly and allied factions responsible for, showing no signs of forgiveness or moderation in her condemnation.

Her fury appears rooted in compassion observers note that despite her fierce temperament in person, she shows infinite patience and genuine tenderness with the sick and injured. Her anger seems entirely reserved for those she views as complicit in unnecessary suffering, particularly political and commercial interests that prioritize procedure or profit over urgent humanitarian action.
