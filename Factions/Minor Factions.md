# Minor Factions of the Flotilla

While the major factions dominate council proceedings and command the largest vessels, the flotilla hosts dozens of smaller organizations, guilds, and independent groups. Each brings specialized expertise, unique agendas, or simply refuses to be left behind while history is being made. Some operate openly, contributing essential services to the expedition. Others pursue shadowy objectives that may not align with the flotilla's stated humanitarian mission.

---

## Scholarly & Religious Organizations

### The Pathfinder Society Delegation

The [Pathfinder Society](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Pathfinder_Society) views the Arcadian Archipelago as perhaps the greatest opportunity for exploration and documentation since the society's founding. Their delegation operates under strict neutrality protocols, documenting discoveries for their Chronicles regardless of which faction makes them. This frustrates the major powers, who want exclusive access to archaeological findings, but the Pathfinders have made it clear they will share their maps, research, and expertise with _all_ factions equally or withdraw entirely. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Voss]] respects their principles, while [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Court Magister Valerian Kade|Court Magister Kade]] has been observed attempting to bribe individual Pathfinders for early access to their findings, with uniformly unsuccessful results.

### Irori's Enlightened Path

A small contingent of monks and scholars devoted to [Irori](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=9), god of self-perfection, joined the expedition seeking Azlanti philosophical texts rumored to contain techniques for achieving physical and mental transcendence. Unlike the competing arcane researchers, these monks care nothing for magical power, only for wisdom and discipline. They have established a practice of offering martial arts training and meditation instruction to any crew member seeking to improve themselves, earning them friends across factional lines. Their leader, a weathered Vudrani monk who has taken a vow of silence, communicates through carefully composed written notes that often contain more insight into flotilla politics than entire council sessions.

### Calistrian Sails

Officially registered as "cultural liaisons and morale specialists," the followers of [Calistria](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=3) aboard the flotilla serve far more purposes than their charter suggests. They operate a floating salon that serves as neutral ground for informal negotiations, provide companionship and entertainment to homesick sailors, and most importantly serve as the flotilla's most effective information brokers. Every secret whispered in their tents eventually finds its way to someone willing to pay for it, and they maintain scrupulous neutrality about who that someone might be. [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Marlowe]] has publicly stated she trusts them more than the official diplomatic channels, while [[The Hands of the Everlight]] pretend they don't exist.

### Pharasmin Reapers

The priests of [Pharasma](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=14) did not join the expedition to explore or profit they came because someone must ensure proper treatment of the dead and guard against necromantic corruption. These gray-robed clerics have made it clear they will be watching closely as tombs are opened and ruins explored, and they possess the authority to declare sites forbidden if undead threats or desecrated graves are discovered. The major factions view them as necessary insurance against catastrophe, though the archaeological interests particularly [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Court Magister Valerian Kade|Kade]] and [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Magister Tertius Vael|Vael]] bristle at the idea of priests vetoing their research. The Pharasmin delegation has made one thing absolutely clear: they will not share vessels with the Ustalavic scholars, and any attempt to force proximity will result in their immediate withdrawal from the expedition.

### The Ustalavic Academic Collective

Perhaps the most controversial presence in the flotilla, the Ustalavic Academic Collective consists of scholars from [Lepidstadt University](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lepidstadt_University) and other [Ustalavic](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ustalav) institutions specialists in ancient civilizations, pre-Earthfall cultures, and necromantic history. What makes them controversial is that several of their most distinguished researchers are undead: a vampire professor of ancient languages, a lich who claims to have witnessed the fall of Azlant firsthand, and a handful of ghosts bound to preserved journals and research materials. These undead scholars possess invaluable knowledge spanning centuries or even millennia, but their very existence is anathema to the [[Pharasmin Reapers]]. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Voss]] had to negotiate an extraordinarily delicate arrangement: the Ustalavic delegation operates from ships positioned at the opposite end of the flotilla from the Pharasmin vessels, they abstain from council votes on matters involving burial practices or the treatment of undead discoveries, and they have agreed not to create new undead during the expedition. The Pharasmin priests grudgingly accepted this compromise, though they have stated that if the Ustalavic scholars violate the agreement, the consequences will be "final and absolute."

### The Church of Nethys

The faithful of [Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=12), god of magic itself, occupy a strange position in the flotilla neither wholly trusted nor entirely dismissed. Their dual nature reflecting their deity's all-seeing wisdom and destructive power manifests in their approach to Azlanti discoveries: they believe all magical knowledge should be both preserved _and_ tested, regardless of the danger. This makes them valuable consultants when ancient magical items are discovered (they can identify nearly anything) and dangerous wildcards when experiments go wrong (which they often do). The church's senior representative openly acknowledges that some magical secrets "should perhaps remain buried," yet continues to assist in uncovering them, trusting Nethys to guide the balance between revelation and restraint.

### The Wandering Muses

A traveling troupe of artists, performers, and dreamers devoted to [Desna](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=5) and [Shelyn](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=17), the Wandering Muses joined the flotilla seeking adventure, inspiration, and new stories to tell. Led by a pair of [azata](https://2e.aonprd.com/MonsterFamilies.aspx?ID=10) a lyrakien poet and a lillend musician who claim to have witnessed some of the most beautiful moments in mortal history, the group includes painters, sculptors, dancers, and storytellers from across the Inner Sea. They see the Arcadian Archipelago as a canvas of untold wonders waiting to be experienced and immortalized in art. The Muses operate without political agenda or commercial interest, moving between ships to perform, create, and celebrate beauty wherever they find it. Their presence has become a welcome respite from factional tensions sailors report that attending one of their impromptu performances helps them remember why exploration matters beyond politics and profit. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/High Healer Valerius|High Healer Valerius]] has noted approvingly that "at least someone remembers that beauty and joy are worth preserving," while the azata leaders have been heard saying they hope to help mortals see the archipelago "not as territory to claim, but as wonder to witness."

## Commercial & Craft Guilds

### The Bounty Hunters' Ledger

One might wonder what need a diplomatic expedition has for a guild of bounty hunters, but the [Bounty Hunters' Ledger](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Bounty_Hunters%27_Ledger) made a compelling case: with hundreds of ships, thousands of crew, and minimal law enforcement, someone needs to handle fugitives, deserters, and criminals. Operating under contract to [[The Assembly of Accord]]'s Temporary Courts of Admiralty, these professional trackers serve as the flotilla's de facto police force. They're surprisingly effective at their work, which has earned them grudging respect even from those who philosophically object to their methods. The [[The Gray Corsairs|Gray Corsairs]] watch them carefully, ensuring they're not used to recapture escaped slaves or political refugees, while [[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority]] has attempted (unsuccessfully) to hire them for "special assignments" outside their official contract.

### The Botanists' Consortium

A coalition of herbalists, alchemists, and natural philosophers from universities across the Inner Sea, the Botanists' Consortium views the Archipelago as an unparalleled opportunity to discover new medicinal plants, alchemical reagents, and agricultural specimens. They've successfully argued that their work serves the humanitarian mission (new herbs could cure the mysterious fever) while also offering commercial value (exotic spices and medicines will fund future expeditions). The [[The Hands of the Everlight|Hands of the Everlight]] actually approve of them, one of the few commercial interests Valerius doesn't openly denounce, because their research has genuine healing applications. The Consortium's chief botanist, an elderly Garundi woman with an encyclopedic knowledge of every plant in the Inner Sea, has stated she expects to spend her final years cataloging Arcadian flora and considers it the perfect way to conclude a distinguished career.

### The Indomitable Explorers' League

If the [[The Pathfinder Society Delegation|Pathfinder Society]] represents scholarly exploration, the Indomitable Explorers' League represents adventurous glory-seeking with better funding. Comprised of wealthy thrill-seekers, expedition veterans, and skilled dungeon-delvers, the League approaches exploration as equal parts archaeology, treasure hunting, and competitive sport. They maintain detailed rankings of member achievements, award elaborate titles for significant discoveries, and treat dangerous ruins the way some people treat big game hunting. The major powers find them simultaneously useful (they're genuinely skilled explorers willing to take risks) and infuriating (they care more about bragging rights than proper documentation). Their current expedition leader, a halfling woman who claims to have explored more ancient tombs than any living person, wears a hat that she swears belonged to a legendary Taldan explorer and carries a whip she insists is "practical, not theatrical."

### The Quill & Witness Society

A collective of journalists, scholars, and independent writers from newspapers across the Inner Sea, the Quill & Witness Society is documenting this historic expedition for public consumption. They publish regular newsletters that get sent back to civilization on supply ships, ensuring the entire Inner Sea follows the flotilla's progress. This makes them simultaneously valuable (good publicity for the mission) and dangerous (any scandal will be reported). [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Voss]] carefully manages their access to council meetings, walking the line between transparency and damage control. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/High Healer Valerius|High Healer Valerius]] actively courts their coverage, using them to publicize the delays and put pressure on bureaucratic factions. [[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority|The Chelish]] treat them with icy courtesy and provide no comment. [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Bastian Vale|Bastian Vale]] regularly provides them with dramatic stories, most of which are only partially fabricated.

### House Thrune Independent Traders

When [House Thrune](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/House_Thrune) took control of Cheliax, many noble houses bent the knee or were destroyed. A few chose a third option: flee with their wealth intact and operate independently. These "Independent Traders" are Chelish merchants who maintain no official ties to the Diabolic Empire, claiming they represent private commercial interests rather than imperial ambitions. [[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority]] regards them with open suspicion, viewing them as either embarrassing remnants of pre-Thrune incompetence or potential spies undermining the official delegation. The Independents insist they're simply here for profit and have no political agenda, but their ships carry suspiciously well-armed escorts, and they seem remarkably well-informed about [[NPCs/Flotilla/Chelish Expeditionary Authority/Armiger-Magistrate Corvain Thorn|Armiger-Magistrate Thorn's]] activities.

### The Silk Syndicate

Technically the Silk Syndicate is a massive [Tian Xia](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Tian_Xia) trade network spanning continents, but their flotilla presence consists of exactly one person: a Tian merchant named Mei Chen who represents the Syndicate's interests with unflappable calm and occasionally mysterious resources. She operates from a small but immaculately maintained ship, speaks perfect Common with a slight accent, and seems to know something about everyone without ever explaining how. When asked why the Syndicate sent only one representative, she replied that "one competent agent accomplishes more than a dozen ambitious fools seeking credit for success not yet earned." She's established trade agreements with four different factions for exclusive access to Arcadian goods, somehow structured so none of the agreements technically conflict while all of them serve the Syndicate's interests. [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Marlowe]] considers her a kindred spirit in the art of profitable negotiation.

### Prophecies Lost Trading Company

Named for the death of prophecy that occurred with [Aroden's](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aroden) demise, this [Varisian](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Varisia) trading company specializes in rare goods, exotic luxuries, and fortune-telling services. Their ships are painted in vibrant colors and crewed by Varisian merchants who view this expedition as the trading opportunity of a lifetime. They've brought extensive stocks of luxury goods to trade with Arcadian peoples, betting that establishing early commercial relationships will pay enormous dividends. Their leader, a charismatic fortune-teller who reads Harrow cards and claims to have foreseen the expedition's success (though she's notably vague about details), has become popular among superstitious sailors seeking favorable readings before dangerous voyages. Whether her predictions hold genuine power or simply provide comfort in uncertain times remains unclear, but her paying customers don't seem to care.

### The Azlanti Pearl Company

The first of three medium-sized trading houses, the Azlanti Pearl Company specializes in oceanic resources: pearls, coral, whale oil, salt, and luxury seafood. They've brought diving teams and specialized equipment for harvesting marine resources, betting that Arcadian waters contain valuable specimens unknown to Inner Sea markets. Their business model depends on establishing regular shipping routes, which makes them natural allies of [[The Assembly of Accord]]'s infrastructure-building agenda. The company's master diver, a Gillman who can spend hours underwater without breathing equipment.

### The Spice Winds Collective

A coalition of merchant families from [Katapesh](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Katapesh) (not affiliated with the nation's official delegation that rejected the flotilla), the Spice Winds Collective focuses on the most valuable prize of the Age of Exploration: spices. A single successful cargo of rare spices can make fortunes, and they've gambled enormous resources on the archipelago containing valuable specimens. They've brought botanists, alchemists, and experienced traders who can recognize valuable plants on sight. Unlike purely extractive operations, they're genuinely interested in trading knowledge with local peoples, figuring that indigenous expertise will reveal resources foreign explorers might miss. Their success or failure could determine whether Arcadian trade becomes a lasting industry or a one-time plunder.

### The Windward Maritime Trust

The third trading house, the Windward Maritime Trust, takes a longer view than most commercial interests. Rather than seeking immediate profit from exotic goods, they're investing in permanent infrastructure: warehouses, docks, merchant networks, and shipping routes. They're effectively betting that the archipelago will become a permanent trade destination and they want to establish themselves as the premier shipping company before competition arrives. This makes them strong supporters of [[The Assembly of Accord]]'s bureaucratic frameworks the Trust _wants_ binding treaties, established ports, and reliable legal systems to protect their investments. Their managing director has publicly stated that "pirates get rich quickly; merchants build dynasties," earning approval from Lord Voss and eye-rolling from more opportunistic interests.

### Koros-Venn Freight Consortium

The largest of the three major shipping companies handling bulk cargo for the flotilla, Koros-Venn built their reputation over two centuries of reliable, if uninspiring, freight transport across the Inner Sea. They operate the greatest number of cargo vessels in the expedition twelve heavy merchantmen designed to carry maximum tonnage with minimal crew. Their ships are practical to the point of ugliness: no gilding, no ornamental figureheads, just reinforced hulls and enormous cargo capacity. The Consortium's flotilla representative, a methodical Dwarf accountant named Torgun Ironledger, treats shipping as a mathematical problem of weight distribution, sailing times, and profit margins. Koros-Venn has secured the largest share of [[The Assembly of Accord]]'s freight contracts through a combination of competitive pricing and demonstrated reliability. They handle most of the expedition's essential supplies: foodstuffs, timber, rope, sailcloth, tools, medical supplies, and the unglamorous but critical materials that keep hundreds of ships operational. Other factions find them boring but dependable—exactly what you want from the company transporting your survival supplies.

### Stormhaven & Daughters

Where Koros-Venn prioritizes volume, Stormhaven & Daughters focuses on speed and specialized cargo. Operating eight fast merchantmen with reduced cargo capacity but superior sailing characteristics, this family-owned Absalom company has built their business on premium shipping: delicate goods, time-sensitive deliveries, and high-value cargo that requires careful handling. The company's matriarch, Captain Vessa Stormhaven, personally commands the flagship. They've also developed excellent working relationships with the specialized factions—the [[The Botanists' Consortium|Botanists' Consortium]] uses Stormhaven vessels exclusively for transporting delicate specimens; the [[The Church of Nethys|Church of Nethys]] trusts them with magical artifacts; [[The Quill & Witness Society]] pays for fast transport of their newsletters back to civilization. This focus on premium services commands higher prices but smaller market share than Koros-Venn's bulk hauling. The company's competitive edge comes from their willingness to take calculated risks sailing through marginal weather, attempting challenging routes, prioritizing speed over absolute safety. This has led to tensions with Koros-Venn, whose representatives argue that Stormhaven's "reckless nautical showmanship" endangers the entire flotilla. Captain Vessa Stormhaven's response: "We're explorers, not accountants. The Inner Sea doesn't reward ships that refuse to leave harbor when clouds form." Her three daughters serve as captains of their own vessels, creating an experienced family command structure.

### The Horizon Line Cooperative

The smallest and most controversial of the three major shipping companies, the Horizon Line Cooperative operates under a radically different business model: worker ownership. Every crew member holds shares in the company; captains are elected by their crews; profits are distributed according to labor contribution rather than invested capital. This democratic structure makes them beloved by common sailors and deeply suspicious to faction leaders who worry that worker-controlled shipping might inspire "unfortunate ideas" among other crews. The Cooperative operates six medium merchant vessels, each independently managed by its crew-elected captain, coordinated through regular shipboard assemblies. They specialize in cargo that other companies consider too risky or insufficiently profitable—transporting supplies for minor factions without major financial backing, hauling goods for indigenous peoples (if and when encountered), accepting unconventional payment arrangements when gold is scarce. [[The Gray Corsairs]] absolutely love them, viewing the Cooperative as proof that democratic principles can succeed even in commercial ventures. [[The Hands of the Everlight]] appreciate their willingness to accept humanitarian missions at reduced rates. [[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority]] views them with open contempt as "maritime anarchists playing at economics," while Koros-Venn's representatives dismiss them as "amateurs who will collapse the moment real competition arrives." The Cooperative's elected spokesperson, a former common sailor named Maris Deepwater who rose to leadership through decades of experience, argues that worker ownership creates superior motivation: "Our crews don't move cargo because a distant owner demands it. They move cargo because their livelihoods depend on reputation, and their reputation depends on the quality of service they personally deliver. When was the last time a Koros-Venn deckhand cared whether a client was satisfied?" The three companies maintain professionally hostile relationships, competing for contracts while occasionally coordinating on logistics that benefit all shipping. The major factions have learned to leverage this competition.

### Chef Gimble's Culinary Expedition

Perhaps the most unusual commercial venture in the flotilla belongs to Gimble Flavourfinch, a [gnome](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=3) chef whose restaurant in Absalom was legendary among the city's elite. At the height of his success, Gimble shocked the culinary world by selling his establishment, using the proceeds to purchase a ship, hire a crew, and join the expedition in search of "flavors that will redefine what food can be." His vessel, _The Golden Spoon_, carries an absurdly well-equipped galley, extensive preservation equipment, and a crew of cooks, foragers, and food scholars. Gimble approaches exploration with the same intensity others reserve for treasure hunting, treating every new plant, spice, or cooking technique as a potential masterpiece waiting to be discovered. Unlike many commercial interests viewing the archipelago as a resource to extract, Gimble insists his primary goal is to learn from indigenous peoples and their culinary traditions. He's stated repeatedly that "the greatest flavors come from centuries of knowledge passed down through culture, not from stealing ingredients," and has made it clear he intends to trade cooking knowledge as equals rather than simply taking what he finds. He's already bartering with [[The Botanists' Consortium]] for specimens, offering to prepare experimental dishes in exchange for samples. His shipboard dinners have become unexpected diplomatic venues crew members from rival factions find it easier to negotiate over Gimble's cooking than in formal council chambers. [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Marlowe]] has been heard saying that "the gnome's risotto is worth the price of admission to this circus," while Gimble himself treats each meal as performance art, declaring that "flavor transcends politics, and a perfect dish can change the world."

## Political & Military Groups

### The Silver Ravens

The [Silver Ravens](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Silver_Ravens) of [Ravounel](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ravounel) represent everything [[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority]] finds threatening: a successful rebellion that proved tyranny could be overthrown through coordinated resistance. This small delegation ostensibly joined the flotilla as representatives of Ravounel's newfound independence, but their true purpose appears to be ensuring Cheliax doesn't establish new colonies to replace what they lost. They coordinate quietly with [[The Gray Corsairs]], sharing intelligence about Chelish activities and standing ready to support any indigenous resistance movements if Cheliax attempts colonial domination. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Chelish Expeditionary Authority/Armiger-Magistrate Corvain Thorn|Armiger-Magistrate Thorn]] has demanded they be expelled as "revolutionary agitators," but [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Voss]] ruled that Ravounel is a sovereign nation entitled to representation. The resulting tension crackles during every council meeting where both delegations are present.

### The Speakers for the Stones

This delegation of [dwarven](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Dwarf) geologists, miners, and earth-shapers joined the expedition offering crucial neutral expertise: they can assess mineral resources, identify geological hazards, and evaluate mining prospects without political agenda. Every faction wants what the islands might hold beneath the surface precious metals, gemstones, rare minerals and the Speakers provide honest assessments that help prevent costly mistakes. They've successfully positioned themselves as indispensable consultants, selling their services at premium rates while maintaining strict neutrality. Their leader, a stoic dwarf who claims to have mapped more underground caverns than any living explorer, has stated that stone "tells no lies, unlike surface-dwellers," and refuses to falsify reports regardless of political pressure or financial incentive.

### The Ironjaw Hunters

A warband of [orcs](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=19) from the [Hold of Belkzen](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Hold_of_Belkzen), the Ironjaw clan joined the flotilla to reclaim honor lost in a disastrous defeat against a rival tribe. Their leader, Warchief Krusk Ironjaw, declared that only by hunting prey worthy of legend could the clan restore its reputation among the orc nations. Rumors of massive creatures in the Arcadian wilderness enormous beasts, ancient megafauna, perhaps even surviving Azlanti war-constructs drew them to the expedition like predators to blood. The Ironjaws operate under a strict interpretation of honorable combat: they hunt only dangerous prey, disdain ambush tactics they consider cowardly, and display trophies from their kills with fierce pride. While their presence initially alarmed other factions, they've proven surprisingly reliable allies when genuine threats emerge. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Admiral Lysandra Korvus|Admiral Korvus]] hired them as scouts after watching them track and kill a sea serpent that threatened the fleet, while [[The Hands of the Everlight]] maintain wary distance, troubled by their glorification of violence yet unable to deny their effectiveness. The Ironjaws have made it clear they care nothing for politics, territory, or treasure; they seek only worthy opponents and the honor that comes from victory in battle. As Warchief Krusk stated bluntly during his sole council appearance: "You argue over maps. We hunt monsters. When you need something dead, you know where to find us."

## Token Observers & Limited Participation

### The Varisian Observation Delegation

[Varisia](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Varisia) has no central government its independent city-states each hold sway over small collections of towns and villages, while competing political interests make unified action nearly impossible. [Riddleport](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Riddleport)'s criminal syndicates, [Magnimar](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Magnimar)'s ambitious merchants, traditionalist [Korvosa](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Korvosa), and the neutral isolationist [Kaer Maga](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kaer_Maga) could never agree on a coordinated expedition. After months of bitter negotiations that produced nothing but deadlock, they compromised by sending a minimal "observation delegation" a single ship carrying one representative from each city-state, tasked only with reporting back on developments. However, what they _have_ agreed upon with alarming unanimity is that whichever Varisian port can position itself as the nearest friendly harbor to the archipelago will dominate new trade routes. Back in Varisia, the city-states are already engaged in fierce competition to establish themselves as the primary hub for Arcadian commerce, offering preferential docking fees, building new warehouses, and recruiting experienced captains. The representatives aboard the flotilla spend less time observing the expedition and more time sending increasingly frantic reports back home, each trying to ensure their city gains the advantage. The sight of four Varisians representing competing interests on the same ship, barely speaking to each other except to argue about trade routes, has become a source of dark humor among other factions. [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Marlowe]] has remarked that "watching Varisians fail to cooperate makes the flotilla's dysfunction look efficient by comparison."

### Kyonin's Polite Distance

[Queen Telandia Edasseril](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Telandia_Edasseril) of [Kyonin](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kyonin) sent formal regards expressing support for the flotilla's humanitarian objectives and hope that "such international cooperation might prevent future conflicts." However, she made it abundantly clear that Kyonin would not be participating directly. The official statement praised the expedition's goals while delicately noting that Kyonin "must focus on matters closer to home" and expressing hope that the flotilla's members would "navigate their competing ambitions with wisdom and restraint." Diplomatic observers understood the subtext immediately: the elven queen recognized the flotilla as a powder keg of conflicting interests and wanted no part of the inevitable explosion.

### The Lands of the Linnorm Kings: Cultural Presence Without Political Representation

The [Lands of the Linnorm Kings](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lands_of_the_Linnorm_Kings) sent no official delegation, no diplomatic representatives, and no coordinated participation. However, anyone familiar with the [Ulfen](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Ulfen) people would recognize their unmistakable presence throughout the flotilla. As some of the finest sailors in the Inner Sea, northerners from the Linnorm Kingdoms can be found crewing vessels across nearly every faction seasoned navigators who've battled arctic storms, experienced raiders turned legitimate merchant sailors, and adventurous youths seeking glory in distant waters. They serve [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Admiral Lysandra Korvus|Admiral Korvus]]'s warships, crew Absalom merchant vessels, and even signed on with [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Marlowe]]'s expedition. When asked why the Linnorm Kings sent no formal representation despite this cultural presence, one Ulfen sailor reportedly laughed and said, "The kings rule kingdoms. They don't rule the sea. We sail where we choose." This individualistic approach means the northerners have no unified political voice in council proceedings, but their expertise in sailing dangerous waters has proven invaluable, and their reputation for fearlessness in combat makes them sought-after crew members across the flotilla.

---

## Notable Absences: Nations That Refused

### Nidal

The shadow-haunted nation of [Nidal](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Nidal) maintained its characteristic isolationism, issuing a terse statement that they "see no need to participate in expeditions to distant lands when our own borders serve our purposes adequately." Several diplomatic observers have noted the humor in Nidal presenting their absence as a choice, given that no invitation was ever extended to the nation sworn to [Zon-Kuthon](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Zon-Kuthon). [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Voss]] privately admitted that inviting Nidal "would have caused every other religious faction to withdraw immediately," while the [[Pharasmin Reapers]] stated flatly that they would have declared the entire expedition morally compromised. Nidal's official response suggested they took their non-invitation as a deliberate slight, though whether they actually cared or simply wanted to appear affronted remains unclear.

### New Thassilon

The reformed realm of [New Thassilon](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/New_Thassilon), still rebuilding from the return of Runelord [Sorshen](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Sorshen) and the transformation of ancient Thassilonian territories, sent polite regards but declined participation. Their response acknowledged the expedition as "certainly interesting" but noted that New Thassilon's resources are "fully committed to establishing stable governance and cannot be diverted to speculative ventures, however promising." However, they made it clear they're watching developments closely and would be "very interested in participating should concrete discoveries justify the investment of our considerable expertise in ancient magics." This wait-and-see approach frustrates the [[The Pathfinder Society Delegation|Pathfinder Society]], who recognize that New Thassilon possesses unparalleled knowledge of pre-Earthfall civilizations but can't commit without proof of findings. The subtext is clear: once the flotilla does the hard work of exploration, New Thassilon will happily swoop in to claim credit for interpreting the discoveries.

### Razmiran

[Razmiran](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Razmiran), the theocracy ruled by the supposed "living god" [Razmir](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Razmir), submitted an application demanding official recognition of Razmir's divinity, a leadership position on the Flotilla Council equal to [[The Hands of the Everlight]], exclusive rights to establish "temples of the First Truth" in any discovered territories, and a share of all magical discoveries "as befits the Living God's divine authority." The demands were so excessive and the tone so imperious that [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Voss]] didn't even dignify them with a formal response. The application was simply filed away and never addressed, leaving Razmiran's delegation waiting for a reply that would never come. After three months of being "left on read," Razmiran's representatives quietly withdrew their application, though they issued a statement declaring that "the Living God's attention is required for matters of far greater import than expeditions organized by those who lack true vision." The entire affair provided considerable amusement to other factions, particularly when it became known that [[The Hands of the Everlight]] had threatened to withdraw immediately if Razmir's "blasphemous pretensions" were granted any legitimacy whatsoever.

### Geb and Nex

The ancient rival nations of [Geb](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Geb) and [Nex](<https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Nex_(nation)>), locked in millennia-old hostility, somehow managed to present a united front on exactly one matter: both declined participation in the flotilla. [Geb](<https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Geb_(person)>), the undead archmage ruling his namesake nation, sent word that "ventures across the Inner Sea hold no interest when eternity provides ample time for lands to come to us." [Nex](<https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Nex_(archmage)>) remains missing as he has for thousands of years, but his ruling [Council of Three and Nine](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Council_of_Three_and_Nine) indicated that Nex's resources were "committed to magical research of far greater significance than mapping distant islands." Diplomatic observers noted with some irony that if either nation _had_ joined, the other would have immediately demanded participation purely to counter their ancient enemy, likely dragging their blood feud into the flotilla's politics. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Voss]] expressed relief that "at least we need not mediate a five-thousand-year-old magical war on top of everything else," while the [[The Ustalavic Academic Collective|Ustalavic undead scholars]] noted with professional disappointment that Geb's personal expertise in necromantic longevity would have been "academically invaluable, if politically catastrophic."

### The Aspis Consortium

The [Aspis Consortium](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aspis_Consortium), long-time rivals to the Pathfinder Society and notorious for ruthless business practices, was initially denied official participation in the flotilla due to their reputation for exploitative operations and disregard for ethical guidelines. The Consortium's response was characteristically pragmatic: if they couldn't join the official expedition, they would simply organize their own. Multiple Consortium ships departed for the Archipelago well before the flotilla completed its preparations, unburdened by treaties, regulations, or humanitarian obligations. Reports indicate they've already established trading posts, conducted archaeological surveys of promising sites, and begun extracting resources without oversight or concern for indigenous rights. The [[The Pathfinder Society Delegation|Pathfinder Society]] views their rival's head start with considerable alarm, knowing that Consortium agents will prioritize profitable plunder over scholarly documentation. The Consortium's absence from the flotilla is less a missed opportunity and more a liberation from constraints they never intended to honor anyway.

### Rahadoum

The atheist nation of [Rahadoum](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Rahadoum) rejected participation in the flotilla after observing that [[The Hands of the Everlight]] held a position of moral authority in the coalition. Rahadoum's Pure Legion made it clear they would not join any expedition where divine intervention was treated as legitimate governance. Instead, they organized their own independent scientific expedition, which departed for the Archipelago weeks before the flotilla completed its bureaucratic preparations. Their fleet carried alchemists, surgeons, and rational philosophers intent on proving that science and reason, not divine healing, can address the Arcadian fever. The flotilla will be arriving second to a capable rival that has already established initial positions and may have secured key locations before negotiations even begin.

### The Osirian-Qadiran Alliance

When [Osirion](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Osirion) and [Qadira](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Qadira) learned that [[The New Army of Exploration]] would have prominent positions in the flotilla's archaeological research, they withdrew their considerable application. Both nations possess deep expertise in ancient civilizations Osirion's archaeologists are renowned throughout the Inner Sea, while Qadira's trade networks could have provided enormous resources. However, they refused to operate in a framework where Taldan "amateurs playing at archaeology" would receive equal credibility. Their joint statement criticized the flotilla's "bureaucratic bloat" and announced they were organizing a separate, more efficient expedition. That expedition departed months ago, while the flotilla was still debating procedural frameworks. This represents a serious loss for the flotilla, both in expertise and resources, and a significant head start for a well-funded rival. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Voss]] has publicly maintained that "quality of cooperation matters more than quantity of participants," though privately he has expressed concern about arriving to find the best archaeological sites already claimed.

### Katapesh

The merchant nation of [Katapesh](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Katapesh) took one look at the Charter of Shared Waters, with its regulations on trade practices, profit-sharing agreements, and commercial oversight, and declined immediately. Katapesh's ruling [Pactmasters](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Pactmasters) sent a brief response: "We trade where trade is profitable and laws are sensible. Your flotilla offers neither." By the time the flotilla was ready to depart, Katapeshi merchant ships had already been sailing to Arcadian waters for weeks, establishing trade contacts and commercial relationships without the burden of international treaties or shared governance. The Pactmasters' rejection was not a missed opportunity it was a calculated decision to avoid bureaucratic constraints while their merchants operated freely. This galls many in the flotilla, particularly those who spent months negotiating frameworks that their competitors simply bypassed by leaving earlier.
