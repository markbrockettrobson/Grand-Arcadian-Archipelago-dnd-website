Driven by a collective, searing vision of an Arcadian plague, an unknown "fever that turns the blood to ash" this sect of [[https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=292&Redirected=1|Sarenrae]]’s faithful didn't just join the flotilla, they ignited it. It was their zeal that secured the initial funding and shamed skilled captains into braving the treacherous crossing to the Western Continent.

However, their holy urgency has soured into a simmering, holy resentment. They view the sprawling international fleet not as a grand achievement, but as a bloated anchor.

To the healers, every merchant ship hunting for exotic spices is a vessel "stealing the wind" from a hospital ship. Every diplomatic frigate arguing over territorial sovereignty represents another hour an indigenous child spends suffering. They are openly disgusted by the "crisis-vultures" tagging along for profit and have reached the limits of their patience with the Bureaucrat’s endless paperwork, they view as a literal death sentence for the people of the Archipelago.

> \_"We asked for a swift mercy-stroke, you gave us a committee. We asked for bandages, you gave us a trade manifesto. While you balance your ledgers in gold, the people of Arcadia are balancing their lives in heartbeats, The sun is rising, and we are still at anchor!" **High Healer Valerius**, addressing the Flotilla Council. 3rd monthly committee

Now, six months after the initial visions, the fleet is finally underway. The Hands are thoroughly disillusioned; they see the five-month delay caused by administrative bickering as a moral failure of the Inner Sea nations. Within the flotilla, they act as the "moral sandpaper," constantly grating against the greed and slow pace of their fellow travelers.

### Notable NPCs

- **[[High Healer Valerius]]:** The faction's fiery spokesperson, known for her refusal to use "polite" diplomatic language during council meetings. A radical pacifist making up for her lack in martial violence with verbal fury, she has a temper to fear and a lot to be angry about.

- **[[Adjudicator Kaelen]]**: The person who walks into a room five minutes after Valerius has stormed out, offering apologies and smoothing over "misunderstandings." He is far more pragmatic, understanding that for all the faults of the flotilla, they need ships and supplies they would otherwise just not have.

- **[[Champion Elara]]**: Champion of Sarenrae, tasked with the impossible job of protecting a pacifist leader who refuses to stay out of danger. She often agrees with Valerius's anger but respects Kaelen's methods, acting as the bridge between the two.

### **Logistics & Hosting**

Despite being the emotional and moral catalyst for the expedition, the Hands of the Everlight possess no ships of their own. Instead, their healers and supplies are distributed across the vessels of the various international factions a situation that has birthed a frustrating "Competitive Hospitality." These host nations view the presence of Sarenrae’s faithful as a badge of moral legitimacy, using the healers as living proof of their "charitable" intent to justify their own territorial or commercial greed. While these factions vie for the prestige of hosting High Healer Valerius, offering her the finest cabins and performative deference, they consistently ignore her demands for speed. To the flotilla’s leadership, the healers are a symbolic shield against public scrutiny; to the healers, they are prisoners of a "bloated anchor" that prioritizes comfortable bureaucracy over the lives they were sent to save.
