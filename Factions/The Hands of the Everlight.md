Driven by a collective, searing vision of an Arcadian plague, an unknown "fever that turns the blood to ash" this sect of [[https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=292&Redirected=1|Sarenrae]]’s faithful didn't just join the flotilla, they ignited it. It was their zeal that secured the initial funding and shamed skilled captains into braving the treacherous crossing to the Western Continent.

However, their holy urgency has visibly soured into simmering resentment. They speak openly of the sprawling international fleet not as a grand achievement, but as a "bloated anchor" that drags against progress.

To the healers, as they state in nearly every council meeting, every merchant ship hunting for exotic spices is a vessel "stealing the wind" from a hospital ship. Every diplomatic frigate arguing over territorial sovereignty represents another hour an indigenous child spends suffering. They express open disgust at what they call the "crisis-vultures" tagging along for profit, and have publicly declared they have reached the limits of their patience with bureaucratic procedures they view as literal death sentences for the people of the Archipelago.

> \_"We asked for a swift mercy-stroke, you gave us a committee. We asked for bandages, you gave us a trade manifesto. While you balance your ledgers in gold, the people of Arcadia are balancing their lives in heartbeats, The sun is rising, and we are still at anchor!" **High Healer Valerius**, addressing the Flotilla Council. 3rd monthly committee

Now, six months after the initial visions, the fleet is finally underway. The Hands appear thoroughly disillusioned, stating repeatedly that they see the five-month delay caused by administrative bickering as a moral failure of the Inner Sea nations. Within the flotilla, they act as what some have called the "moral sandpaper," constantly grating against what they perceive as greed and complacency among their fellow travelers.

### Notable NPCs

- **[[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/High Healer Valerius|High Healer Valerius]]:** The faction's fiery spokesperson, known for her refusal to use "polite" diplomatic language during council meetings. A radical pacifist making up for her lack in martial violence with verbal fury, she has a temper to fear and a lot to be angry about.

- **[[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/Adjudicator Kaelen|Adjudicator Kaelen]]**: The person who walks into a room five minutes after Valerius has stormed out, offering apologies and smoothing over "misunderstandings." He is far more pragmatic, understanding that for all the faults of the flotilla, they need ships and supplies they would otherwise just not have.

- **[[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/Champion Elara|Champion Elara]]**: Champion of Sarenrae, tasked with the impossible job of protecting a pacifist leader who refuses to stay out of danger. She often agrees with Valerius's anger but respects Kaelen's methods, acting as the bridge between the two.

### **Logistics & Hosting**

Despite being the emotional and moral catalyst for the expedition, the Hands of the Everlight possess no ships of their own. Instead, their healers and supplies are distributed across the vessels of the various international factions a situation that has birthed a frustrating "Competitive Hospitality." These host nations view the presence of Sarenrae’s faithful as a badge of moral legitimacy, using the healers as living proof of their "charitable" intent to justify their own territorial or commercial greed. While these factions vie for the prestige of hosting High Healer Valerius, offering her the finest cabins and performative deference, they consistently ignore her demands for speed. To the flotilla’s leadership, the healers are a symbolic shield against public scrutiny; to the healers, they are prisoners of a "bloated anchor" that prioritizes comfortable bureaucracy over the lives they were sent to save.
### **Relationship with The New Army of Exploration**

[[High Healer Valerius]] has made no secret of her contempt for [[The New Army of Exploration]], viewing Taldor's presence as perhaps the clearest example of everything wrong with the flotilla. During one particularly heated council session, she publicly denounced all three Taldan leaders by name, accusing them of treating a humanitarian crisis as an opportunity for personal glory and treasure hunting.

Her specific criticisms vary by target. She has called [[NPCs/Surveyor-General Octavia Rhen|Surveyor-General Rhen]] "well-intentioned but complicit," suggesting that Rhen's genuine ethical concerns are undermined by her failure to rein in her colleagues. [[NPCs/Court Magister Valerian Kade|Court Magister Kade]]'s obsession with Azlanti artifacts has been condemned as "grave-robbing dressed in academic robes." [[NPCs/Ambassador-Envoy Cassius Orell|Ambassador-Envoy Orell]]'s speeches about "Taldor's glorious return to exploration" have been dismissed as "narcissistic drivel from a man who mistakes pageantry for purpose."

The Hands of the Everlight have refused Taldan offers to host healers aboard their vessels, stating publicly that they will not provide moral legitimacy to "glory-seekers and plunderers." This rejection represents one of the rare instances where the Hands have turned down logistical support, suggesting the depth of their moral opposition.

[[Adjudicator Kaelen]], characteristically, attempts to moderate Valerius's public denunciations, acknowledging that the Taldan delegation "could be worse" and noting that at least they have not actively obstructed humanitarian efforts like some factions. This faint praise has done little to improve relations.
### **Allies**

While the Hands of the Everlight's frustration extends to nearly every faction in the flotilla, they have found common cause with [[The Gray Corsairs]] on matters of humanitarian principle. Both factions prioritize the welfare of the archipelago's people over political maneuvering, and both view colonial exploitation with deep suspicion.

The alliance is not without friction the Hands' religious pacifism doesn't always align with the Gray Corsairs' willingness to use force against slavers and tyrants. High Healer Valerius has expressed discomfort with what she calls the Corsairs' "righteous violence," even when directed at clear injustice. However, both groups recognize they share more in common with each other than with factions that view the archipelago primarily as commercial or political opportunity.
