## The Major Factions

### [[The Assembly of Accord]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]]  
**Power Base:** Absalom's political and merchant elite

Representing Absalom's interests, the Assembly seeks to establish lasting frameworks for international cooperation. They command the finest ships in the flotilla and hold significant economic influence. Their insistence on "doing things properly" transformed a mercy mission into a five-month bureaucratic process.

**Key Goal:** Build legal frameworks that will outlast the current generation and reshape international relations.

---

### [[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/Chelish Expeditionary Authority/Armiger-Magistrate Corvain Thorn|Armiger-Magistrate Corvain Thorn]]  
**Power Base:** The Empire of Cheliax and Hellknight Orders

The Chelish delegation wields bureaucracy as a weapon, using legal procedure to control the expedition's pace. Backed by disciplined Hellknight enforcers from the Order of the Rack and Order of the Chain, they publicly champion lawful order while many suspect colonial ambitions.

**Key Goal:** Ensure Cheliax claims territory through internationally recognized legal frameworks (or prevent rivals from doing so first).

---

### [[The Gray Corsairs]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/Gray Corsairs/Captain Isla Stormwright|Captain Isla Stormwright]]  
**Power Base:** Andoran and the Steel Falcons

Freedom fighters who joined the expedition to prevent the Archipelago from becoming another colonial prize or haven for slavers. They support democratic self-governance and oppose both imperial domination and lawless chaos. Their presence is a direct response to Cheliax's participation.

**Key Goal:** Ensure the islands remain free from colonial exploitation and slavery.

---

### [[The Hands of the Everlight]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/High Healer Valerius|High Healer Valerius]]  
**Power Base:** Sarenrae's faithful, moral authority

Driven by collective visions of plague in the Archipelago, this sect of Sarenrae's clergy ignited the entire expedition. Their holy urgency has soured into resentment toward bureaucratic delays they view as morally catastrophic. They act as the flotilla's conscience and harshest critics.

**Key Goal:** Reach the Archipelago and combat the plague before more lives are lost.

---

### [[The Red Wake]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Serafina Marlowe]]  
**Power Base:** Personal expertise and reputation

Unapologetic opportunists operating as highly-paid consultants. Captain Marlowe is the only living captain to successfully navigate Arcadian waters three times, making her knowledge irreplaceable. She treats her council seat as a sinecure while collecting substantial fees.

**Key Goal:** Profit from navigational expertise while building legendary reputation.

## Factional Relationships

### Alliances & Tensions

**The Assembly ↔ Cheliax:** Publicly cordial (both champion legal procedure), but Voss grows frustrated with Chelish obstruction.

**The Gray Corsairs ↔ Cheliax:** Open hostility. The Corsairs view Cheliax as the greatest threat to freedom; Cheliax calls them "revolutionary agitators."

**The Hands ↔ Everyone:** Frustrated with delays, but maintain working relationships. Closest to the Gray Corsairs on humanitarian matters.

**The Assembly ↔ The Gray Corsairs:** Mutual respect for rule of law, but Voss finds their confrontational approach diplomatically inconvenient.

**The Red Wake ↔ Everyone:** Professional necessity. Most factions disdain Marlowe's mercenary ethics but need her expertise.
