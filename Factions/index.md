# Factions of the Flotilla

The expedition to the Arcadian Archipelago comprises seven major factions, each with their own motivations, resources, and vision for the islands.

## The Major Factions

### [[The Assembly of Accord]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]]  
**Power Base:** Absalom's political and merchant elite

Representing Absalom's interests, the Assembly seeks to establish lasting frameworks for international cooperation. They command the finest ships in the flotilla and hold significant economic influence. Their insistence on "doing things properly" transformed a mercy mission into a five-month bureaucratic process.

**Key Goal:** Build legal frameworks that will outlast the current generation and reshape international relations.

---

### [[The Chelish Expeditionary Authority]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/Chelish Expeditionary Authority/Armiger-Magistrate Corvain Thorn|Armiger-Magistrate Corvain Thorn]]  
**Power Base:** The Empire of Cheliax and Hellknight Orders

The Chelish delegation wields bureaucracy as a weapon, using legal procedure to control the expedition's pace. Backed by disciplined Hellknight enforcers from the Order of the Rack and Order of the Chain, they publicly champion lawful order while many suspect colonial ambitions.

**Key Goal:** Ensure Cheliax claims territory through internationally recognized legal frameworks (or prevent rivals from doing so first).

---

### [[The Gray Corsairs]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/Gray Corsairs/Captain Isla Stormwright|Captain Isla Stormwright]]  
**Power Base:** Andoran and the Steel Falcons

Freedom fighters who joined the expedition to prevent the Archipelago from becoming another colonial prize or haven for slavers. They support democratic self-governance and oppose both imperial domination and lawless chaos. Their presence is a direct response to Cheliax's participation.

**Key Goal:** Ensure the islands remain free from colonial exploitation and slavery.

---

### [[The Hands of the Everlight]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/High Healer Valerius|High Healer Valerius]]  
**Power Base:** Sarenrae's faithful, moral authority

Driven by collective visions of plague in the Archipelago, this sect of Sarenrae's clergy ignited the entire expedition. Their holy urgency has soured into resentment toward bureaucratic delays they view as morally catastrophic. They act as the flotilla's conscience and harshest critics.

**Key Goal:** Reach the Archipelago and combat the plague before more lives are lost.

---

### [[The Magaambya]]

**Leader:** Speaker Initiate Kofi Osondu  
**Power Base:** World's oldest magical academy, ten millennia of preserved knowledge

Representing the Magaambya, the world's oldest continuous magical academy founded before Earthfall, this delegation brings a radically different perspective to the expedition. They possess extensive pre-Earthfall knowledge of Arcadia and view the archipelago not as territory to claim or artifacts to extract, but as an opportunity to learn from and collaborate with indigenous peoples. Their commitment to sharing knowledge freely and prioritizing living magical practice over dead relics earns them respect from humanitarian factions and frustration from competitive researchers.

**Key Goal:** Learn from indigenous magical traditions and share knowledge as equals, not extractors.

---

### [[The New Army of Exploration]]

**Leaders:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Surveyor-General Octavia Rhen|Surveyor-General Octavia Rhen]], [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Court Magister Valerian Kade|Court Magister Valerian Kade]], [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Ambassador-Envoy Cassius Orell|Ambassador-Envoy Cassius Orell]]  
**Power Base:** Taldor's government and historical prestige

Taldor's delegation seeks to reclaim their nation's legacy as explorers while distancing themselves from their colonial past. However, their triumvirate leadership structure with three competing leaders pursuing different agendas (ethical reform, artifact collection, and imperial glory) creates internal dysfunction that undermines their effectiveness.

**Key Goal:** Restore Taldor's reputation as exploration experts (though the three leaders disagree on how).

---

### [[The Red Wake]]

**Leader:** [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Serafina Marlowe]]  
**Power Base:** Personal expertise and reputation

Unapologetic opportunists operating as highly-paid consultants. Captain Marlowe is the only living captain to successfully navigate Arcadian waters three times, making her knowledge irreplaceable. She treats her council seat as a sinecure while collecting substantial fees.

**Key Goal:** Profit from navigational expertise while building legendary reputation.

---

## Factional Relationships

With seven major factions representing diverse interests, motivations, and moral frameworks, the flotilla navigates a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and pragmatic necessities. Below is a comprehensive guide to how the factions view and interact with each other.

---

### The Assembly of Accord

**With Cheliax:** Publicly cordial professional relationship. Both champion legal procedure and framework-building, making them natural collaborators on establishing governance structures. However, [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Voss]] grows increasingly frustrated with Chelish obstruction tactics and suspects their bureaucratic delays serve territorial ambitions rather than legitimate governance concerns.

**With The Gray Corsairs:** Respectful but tense. The Assembly appreciates the Corsairs' commitment to rule of law and democratic principles, but finds their confrontational approach to Cheliax diplomatically inconvenient. Both factions want structured governance rather than anarchy, but disagree on how aggressive opposition to imperial powers should be.

**With The Hands:** Strained working relationship. The Assembly respects the Hands' moral authority and humanitarian mission, but has been the primary target of their criticism for transforming an urgent mercy mission into a five-month bureaucratic process. Voss maintains professional courtesy while privately resenting accusations of valuing procedure over lives.

**With The Magaambya:** Professionally collaborative with philosophical tensions. The Assembly values the Magaambya's ancient knowledge and willingly consults their expertise on pre-Earthfall civilizations. However, Assembly leadership finds the Magaambyan approach idealistic. The Assembly cannot dismiss them as naive (ten millennia of institutional survival speaks for itself), but neither do they fully embrace their philosophy.

**With The New Army:** Positive but frustrated. The Assembly values Taldor's presence as proof of international cooperation and appreciates their exploratory expertise. However, the triumvirate's inability to present unified positions undermines their effectiveness as diplomatic partners. Voss maintains cordial relations with [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Surveyor-General Octavia Rhen|Surveyor-General Rhen]] while avoiding [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Ambassador-Envoy Cassius Orell|Ambassador-Envoy Orell]]'s presumptuous claims about Taldan leadership.

**With The Red Wake:** Professional necessity. The Assembly pays [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Marlowe]]'s fees and consults her expertise while maintaining public distance from her mercenary ethics. They need her knowledge but prefer not to advertise the association too prominently.

---

### The Chelish Expeditionary Authority

**With The Assembly:** Tactical alliance concealing deeper tensions. Cheliax and Absalom collaborate on framework-building while pursuing fundamentally different goals. Cheliax uses legal procedure as a weapon to secure territorial advantages; the Assembly seeks lasting international cooperation. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Chelish Expeditionary Authority/Armiger-Magistrate Corvain Thorn|Armiger-Magistrate Thorn]] views Voss as useful but ultimately disposable.

**With The Gray Corsairs:** Open hostility barely constrained by the Charter of Shared Waters. Cheliax views the Gray Corsairs as dangerous revolutionary ideologues whose naive idealism about "freedom" and "democracy" threatens to destabilize any proper governance structures. Thorn publicly denounces them as "revolutionary agitators masquerading as peacekeepers" and considers their presence a direct threat to Chelish interests. The fact that Corsair hands drift toward weapons whenever Chelish officials speak of "proper governance" only confirms, in Thorn's view, their fundamental lawlessness. Only the Charter and military pragmatism prevent Cheliax from addressing the Corsair problem more directly.

**With The Hands:** Contemptuous dismissal masked by diplomatic courtesy. Cheliax views the Hands' moral urgency as naive idealism that interferes with proper governance. The Hands view Chelish bureaucracy as morally catastrophic delay tactics. They maintain minimal working relationships required by the expedition's structure.

**With The Magaambya:** Philosophical incompatibility verging on mutual disregard. Thorn calls them "primitives who mistake sentiment for scholarship," completely missing the irony of a devil-worshiping imperial autocracy calling the world's oldest magical academy "primitive" .

**With The New Army:** Contemptuous dismissal. Cheliax views Taldor as a declining empire clinging to faded glory, proof that "incompetence eventually devours even the mightiest empire." Thorn treats Taldan delegation efforts with barely concealed disdain. The historical tension (Cheliax as former Taldan province) adds bitterness to the relationship.

**With The Red Wake:** Formal professional arrangement devoid of trust. Cheliax pays for Marlowe's navigational expertise while viewing her with open contempt as a mercenary opportunist. Marlowe finds this hilarious and happily accepts their coin while mocking their pretensions.

---

### The Gray Corsairs

**With The Assembly:** Respectful but watchful. Both factions value rule of law and structured governance, creating common ground. However, the Corsairs remain vigilant that Assembly frameworks might enable colonial claims they oppose. They support Voss's intentions while carefully monitoring implementation.

**With Cheliax:** Existential opposition. The Gray Corsairs joined the expedition specifically to prevent Cheliax from establishing colonial control or introducing slavery to the archipelago. This is not diplomatic disagreement it is principled opposition to everything Cheliax represents. Only the Charter prevents open conflict.

**With The Hands:** Natural allies on humanitarian principles. Both factions prioritize protecting vulnerable peoples over political maneuvering. They coordinate frequently on issues of ethics and indigenous rights. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Gray Corsairs/Captain Isla Stormwright|Captain Isla Stormwright]] and [[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/High Healer Valerius|High Healer Valerius]] share mutual respect and similar frustrations with bureaucratic delays.

**With The Magaambya:** Ideological alignment with tactical differences. Both oppose colonial exploitation and support indigenous self-determination. However, the Corsairs are prepared to defend these principles with force, while the Magaambya relies on diplomacy and ethical persuasion. Stormwright respects their principles but sometimes finds total pacifism frustrating. The Magaambya notes that violence begets multigenerational cycles of violence, and they've maintained their institution peacefully longer than most nations have existed a point the Corsairs grudgingly acknowledge.

**With The New Army:** Cautiously hopeful but skeptical. The Corsairs respect [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Surveyor-General Octavia Rhen|Surveyor-General Rhen]]'s genuine commitment to ethical exploration. However, they view [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Ambassador-Envoy Cassius Orell|Ambassador-Envoy Orell]]'s "civilized annexation" rhetoric with deep suspicion as colonialism with better marketing. The relationship hinges on which leader represents Taldor's true intentions.

**With The Red Wake:** Pragmatic necessity with cautious respect. The Corsairs recognize that [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Marlowe]]'s knowledge of Arcadian waters is invaluable, and they appreciate that she's been willing to share information about indigenous peoples without attempting to exploit them for profit. Her past as a pirate troubles them less than her present mercenary ethics, they worry that her loyalty flows toward gold rather than principles. Still, [[NPCs/Flotilla/Gray Corsairs/Captain Isla Stormwright|Stormwright]] maintains professional courtesy and has noted that Marlowe, unlike some faction leaders, at least doesn't pretend her motivations are anything other than what they are. Honest avarice is easier to work with than disguised imperialism.

---

### The Hands of the Everlight

**With The Assembly:** Frustrated moral opposition to bureaucratic delay. The Hands blame the Assembly more than any other faction for transforming an urgent plague response into a five-month bureaucratic process. They maintain working relationships but deliver harsh public criticism. Every delay represents lives lost in their view.

**With Cheliax:** Minimal cooperation dictated by necessity. The Hands view Chelish bureaucratic obstruction as morally catastrophic and suspect devil-binding magic is spiritually dangerous. Cheliax views them as naive idealists. They interact only when required by expedition structure.

**With The Gray Corsairs:** Strong allies united by humanitarian principles. Both prioritize protecting vulnerable peoples and oppose colonial exploitation. They coordinate frequently on issues of ethics and indigenous rights, and maintain genuine mutual respect. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Gray Corsairs/Captain Isla Stormwright|Captain Isla Stormwright]] and [[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/High Healer Valerius|High Healer Valerius]] share similar frustrations with bureaucratic delays and work well together, though the Hands' warmest relationship is with [[The Magaambya]].

**With The Magaambya:** Kindred spirits on humanitarian approach. The Hands deeply appreciate the Magaambya's commitment to collaborative learning rather than extractive research, and their emphasis on sharing knowledge to serve communities aligns with Sarenite values. Practical cooperation includes the Magaambya teaching healing magic while the Hands provide immediate medical care. [[NPCs/Flotilla/Hands of the Everlight/High Healer Valerius|High Healer Valerius]] considers [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Magaambya/Speaker Initiate Kofi Osondu|Speaker Initiate Osondu]] a kindred spirit.

**With The New Army:** Open criticism of perceived glory-seeking. The Hands denounce the Taldan delegation as driven more by restoring national prestige than by genuine humanitarian concern. They respect Rhen's integrity but view Kade and Orell as embodiments of exactly the wrong motivations for exploration.

**With The Red Wake:** Complicated tolerance. The Hands morally disapprove of Marlowe's mercenary approach and past as a pirate, but acknowledge her expertise is genuinely necessary. They maintain professional distance while recognizing her value to the mission. Marlowe finds their moral superiority amusing but respects their commitment to healing.

---

### The Magaambya

**With The Assembly:** Collaborative but philosophically divergent. The Magaambya shares historical knowledge freely with Assembly researchers and appreciates Voss's organizational capacity. However, they question the Assembly's tendency to impose structures rather than discover them through dialogue with indigenous peoples. They cannot be dismissed as idealistic naive (ten thousand years of institutional success proves their approach works), which frustrates Assembly pragmatists who find their perspective impractical for territorial negotiations.

**With Cheliax:** Polite mutual disregard. The Magaambya views Cheliax's approach (bureaucratic control, hierarchical authority, devil-binding) as fundamentally incompatible with ethical scholarship. Thorn's contempt for them as "primitives" is met with calm indifference. The Magaambya neither seeks Chelish approval nor cares about Chelish opinion, while quietly but firmly opposing any Chelish colonial governance over indigenous populations.

**With The Gray Corsairs:** Aligned principles with different methods. Both oppose colonial exploitation and support indigenous self-determination, creating natural ideological alliance. They differ on tactics—Corsairs prepared for force, Magaambya committed to pacifist persuasion. Mutual respect despite methodological differences. The Magaambya's millennia of peaceful institutional survival gives weight to their pacifist argument. The Magaambya dislikes the inherent dismissal of the local peoples' ability to defend themselves and finds the notion that the local people need protection patronizing. They do however respect the intent behind the Corsairs' approach.

**With The Hands:** Natural humanitarian alliance. Deep mutual respect for each other's commitment to serving people rather than pursuing power. Practical cooperation combining Magaambyan magical instruction with Sarenite healing creates effective partnerships. Both delegations frequently coordinate on ethical issues and indigenous rights. Among the warmest factional relationships.

**With The New Army:** Variable depending on which Taldan leader. The Magaambya respects Rhen's ethical approach and offers expertise freely to her surveyors. They maintain polite distance from Orell's "civilizing mission" rhetoric. Their relationship with [[NPCs/Flotilla/New Army of Exploration/Court Magister Valerian Kade|Court Magister Kade]] is particularly telling: he views them as rivals holding superior knowledge; they view him with pity as a brilliant scholar so obsessed with claiming artifacts he cannot recognize freely offered wisdom. Multiple collaboration invitations rejected.

**With The Red Wake:** The Magaambya values Marlowe's experiential knowledge of Arcadian cultures and treats her past without judgment, believing in redemption and growth. Marlowe appreciates their lack of moral superiority and has shared cultural/linguistic information more freely with them than with factions she trusts less.

---

### The New Army of Exploration

**With The Assembly:** Valued but frustrated partnership. The Assembly appreciates Taldor's presence as proof of international cooperation and values their exploratory expertise. However, the triumvirate's inability to present unified positions undermines their diplomatic effectiveness. Voss maintains cordial relations with Rhen while avoiding Orell's presumptuous rhetoric.

**With Cheliax:** Historical bitterness and present contempt. Cheliax (former Taldan province) treats Taldor with barely concealed disdain as a declining empire. Thorn dismisses them as "proof that incompetence eventually devours even the mightiest empire." Attempted professional courtesy by Rhen is rebuffed.

**With The Gray Corsairs:** Relationship depends on which Taldan leader speaks. The Corsairs respect Rhen's genuine ethical commitment but view Orell's "civilized annexation" as colonialism rebranded. The central question: which Taldor prevails—Rhen's reformist vision or Orell's imperial nostalgia?

**With The Hands:** Public condemnation as glory-seekers. The Hands view the Taldan delegation as driven by national prestige rather than humanitarian concern. They respect Rhen individually but condemn the delegation's overall motivations, particularly Orell's rhetoric and Kade's artifact obsession.

**With The Magaambya:** Mixed relationships by leader. The Magaambya respects Rhen and offers expertise freely; maintains polite distance from Orell; views Kade with pity as someone who rejects offered wisdom in favor of competitive acquisition. Kade views them as rivals; they view him as a cautionary tale about obsession blinding brilliance.

**With The Red Wake:** Wary pragmatism. The delegation benefits from Marlowe's expertise despite Orell's protests about "consorting with pirates." Rhen treats her professionally; Kade attempts private information exchanges about Azlanti sites (to Rhen's disapproval). Marlowe finds the internal Taldan dysfunction entertaining and profitable.

---

### The Red Wake

**With The Assembly:** Professional client relationship. The Assembly pays well for navigational expertise while maintaining public distance. Marlowe finds this hilarious and happily accepts substantial fees while treating her council seat as a sinecure.

**With Cheliax:** Mercenary arrangement devoid of mutual respect. Cheliax pays for expertise while viewing Marlowe with contempt. Marlowe finds Chelish self-importance boring and happily accepts their coin.

**With The Gray Corsairs:** Professionally cordial despite ideological differences. The Corsairs appreciate Marlowe's knowledge and information-sharing about indigenous peoples. She respects their principles while finding their idealism occasionally naive. Mutual professional respect without endorsing each other's approaches.

**With The Hands:** Professionally distant but mutually useful. Marlowe finds the Hands' moral disapproval of her mercenary career amusing—they need her expertise but clearly wish they didn't have to associate with someone of her reputation. She respects their genuine commitment to healing and acknowledges they're among the few people in the flotilla actually here for the right reasons, even if their self-righteousness can be tiresome. She maintains professional distance not because she fears their judgment, but because getting too close to zealots of any stripe tends to complicate business arrangements.

**With The Magaambya:** Surprisingly warm. The Magaambya treats Marlowe's knowledge respectfully and judges her past lightly, believing in redemption. She appreciates their lack of condescension and has shared cultural information more freely with them than other factions Trust through mutual respect.

**With The New Army:** Source of profit and entertainment. Marlowe benefits from Taldan navigational needs and finds their internal dysfunction entertaining. Rhen's professionalism earns respect; Kade's private dealings are profitable; Orell's protests about "pirate associations" are hilarious.
