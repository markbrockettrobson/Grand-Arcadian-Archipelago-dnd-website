# The Red Wake

Where most factions aboard the flotilla cloak their ambitions in the language of mercy, diplomacy, or international cooperation, **Captain Serafina "Red Wake" Marlowe** and her crew make no such pretense. They are here for profit plain, honest, and unapologetic. Some call her a pirate lord. Others, a privateer who openly changes sides depending on who pays better. The truth lies somewhere in the uncomfortable space between, and Captain Marlowe finds the ambiguity deliciously profitable.

Most of the reputable factions treat her with open disdain. [[The Hands of the Everlight]] see her as everything wrong with the expedition greed personified. [[The Assembly of Accord]]'s diplomats find her presence distasteful, a reminder that not all problems can be solved with charters and committees. The merchant houses view her as competition with fewer scruples. Marlowe enjoys every bit of the infamy. She knows something they refuse to acknowledge openly: she is indispensable.

Captain Marlowe has successfully piloted her ship through the Arcadian seas **three times**, each expedition bringing back plunder that proved both the danger and the opportunity of the islands. No captain in the Inner Sea can match that record. Her knowledge of the treacherous currents, hidden reefs, and navigable passages is quite literally irreplaceable. The Assembly knows this. Lord Voss knows this. And Captain Marlowe knows they know, which is why she commands a price that would make most merchant houses blanch.

She is being paid very well _very_ well for offering her "advisory services" to the flotilla. She seldom uses her seat at the council table, perfectly content to be paid by the day while the diplomats sign whatever papers they like. Why waste time arguing over territorial frameworks when you're being compensated handsomely just to show up? While [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] crafts his legacy through bureaucracy, Marlowe is crafting hers through simple, effective pragmatism: get paid, survive, and let the bards write the songs.

Speaking of which, her first mate is exactly that **[[Bastian Vale]]**, a bard whose sole responsibility is chronicling Captain Marlowe's exploits in increasingly dramatic verse. The rest of the council finds this absurd. Marlowe finds it essential branding.

Even [[Admiral Lysandra Korvus]], who barely conceals her contempt for the captain's mercenary ethics, cannot deny Marlowe's skill as a pilot. In private conversations, the Admiral has admitted (grudgingly) that Marlowe's knowledge of Arcadian waters may be the difference between the flotilla's success and catastrophic failure. This professional respect is mutual Marlowe recognizes competence when she sees it, and Admiral Korvus runs a tight, efficient fleet. They will never be friends, but they understand each other in the way that only true professionals can.

> _"The council can vote to censure me, fine me, or formally condemn my 'lack of decorum.' But they can't dismiss me. Three successful crossings buys a lot of tolerance for bad behavior and I intend to test exactly how much."_ **- Captain Serafina Marlowe**

### Notable NPCs

- **[[Captain Serafina Marlowe]]**: The "Red Wake" herself, legendary pilot and unapologetic opportunist. Three-time veteran of Arcadian waters,currently being paid a small fortune to share her navigational expertise while enjoying the schadenfreude of watching bureaucrats argue.

- **[[Bastian Vale]]**: First mate, bard, and professional chronicler of Captain Marlowe's exploits. His job is to make sure every tavern from here to Absalom knows exactly who piloted through the Widow's Teeth in a storm and lived to boast about it.

### Ships and Resources

- **The Red Wake**: Captain Marlowe's ship, a swift brigantine built for speed and maneuverability rather than firepower. She's survived three trips through Arcadian waters because she doesn't fight battles she can't win she outruns them. The ship's red sails are visible for miles, a deliberate choice that Marlowe claims is "good for business."

### Position in the Flotilla

Captain Marlowe occupies a unique and uncomfortable position within the expedition's power structure. She has a seat on the Flotilla Council as a "chief navigational advisor," though she treats it as a sinecure. She attends perhaps one meeting in five, and when she does appear, she spends most of the time visibly bored, occasionally interjecting with brutally practical observations that puncture hours of diplomatic posturing.

The Assembly cannot dismiss her her knowledge is too valuable. The other factions cannot outbid the Assembly for her exclusive services Absalom's treasury is too deep. So she remains, a constant reminder that some problems cannot be solved with idealism or procedure, only with hard-won expertise and the willingness to name your price.
