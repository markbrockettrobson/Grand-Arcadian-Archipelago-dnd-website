# The Red Wake

Where most factions aboard the flotilla cloak their ambitions in the language of mercy, diplomacy, or international cooperation, **Captain Serafina "Red Wake" Marlowe** and her crew make no such pretense. They are here for profit plain, honest, and unapologetic. Some call her a pirate lord. Others, a privateer who openly changes sides depending on who pays better. The truth lies somewhere in the uncomfortable space between, and Captain Marlowe appears entirely comfortable with the ambiguity.

Most of the reputable factions treat her with open disdain. [[The Hands of the Everlight]] publicly denounce her as everything wrong with the expedition greed personified. [[The Assembly of Accord]]'s diplomats visibly stiffen when she enters council chambers, as though her presence reminds them that not all problems can be solved with charters and committees. The merchant houses view her ship with suspicion, seeing competition with fewer scruples. Captain Marlowe appears entirely unbothered by the infamy. If anything, she seems to lean into it. She knows something they refuse to acknowledge openly: she is indispensable.

Captain Marlowe has successfully piloted her ship through the Arcadian seas **three times**, each expedition bringing back plunder and tales of danger that proved both the challenges and the opportunities of the islands. No captain currently in the Inner Sea can claim a comparable record. Her knowledge of the treacherous currents, hidden reefs, and navigable passages is demonstrably irreplaceable. The Assembly knows this. Lord Voss knows this. And Captain Marlowe's negotiating position suggests she knows they know.

She is being paid very well for offering her "advisory services" to the flotilla rumors suggest her compensation would make most merchant houses blanch. She seldom uses her seat at the council table, often appearing bored during lengthy procedural debates. Why waste time arguing over territorial frameworks when you're being compensated handsomely just to show up? While [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]] works to craft his legacy through bureaucratic frameworks, Marlowe appears focused on simpler priorities: get paid, survive, and ensure the stories spread.

Speaking of which, her first mate is exactly that **[[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Bastian Vale|Bastian Vale]]**, a bard whose sole responsibility is chronicling Captain Marlowe's exploits in increasingly dramatic verse. The rest of the council finds this absurd. Marlowe finds it essential branding.

Even [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Admiral Lysandra Korvus|Admiral Lysandra Korvus]], who barely conceals her contempt for the captain's mercenary ethics, has acknowledged Marlowe's navigational skill. While the Admiral clearly dislikes Marlowe's approach to professional ethics, she has stated publicly that Marlowe's knowledge of Arcadian waters "may prove essential to the flotilla's success." The two maintain a relationship of professional necessity they will likely never be friends, but they appear to recognize competence when they see it.

> _"The council can vote to censure me, fine me, or formally condemn my 'lack of decorum.' But they can't dismiss me. Three successful crossings buys a lot of tolerance for bad behavior and I intend to test exactly how much."_ **- Captain Serafina Marlowe**

### Notable NPCs

- **[[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Captain Serafina Marlowe|Captain Serafina Marlowe]]**: The "Red Wake" herself, legendary pilot and unapologetic opportunist. Three-time veteran of Arcadian waters,currently being paid a small fortune to share her navigational expertise while enjoying the schadenfreude of watching bureaucrats argue.

- **[[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Bastian Vale|Bastian Vale]]**: First mate, bard, and professional chronicler of Captain Marlowe's exploits. His job is to make sure every tavern from here to Absalom knows exactly who piloted through the Widow's Teeth in a storm and lived to boast about it.

### Ships and Resources

- **The Red Wake**: Captain Marlowe's ship, a swift brigantine built for speed and maneuverability rather than firepower. She's survived three trips through Arcadian waters because she doesn't fight battles she can't win she outruns them. The ship's red sails are visible for miles, a deliberate choice that Marlowe claims is "good for business."

### Position in the Flotilla

Captain Marlowe occupies a unique and uncomfortable position within the expedition's power structure. She has a seat on the Flotilla Council as a "chief navigational advisor," though she treats it as a sinecure. She attends perhaps one meeting in five, and when she does appear, she spends most of the time visibly bored, occasionally interjecting with brutally practical observations that puncture hours of diplomatic posturing.

The Assembly cannot dismiss her her knowledge is too valuable. The other factions cannot outbid the Assembly for her exclusive services Absalom's treasury is too deep. So she remains, a constant reminder that some problems cannot be solved with idealism or procedure, only with hard-won expertise and the willingness to name your price.

### The Taldan Situation

Captain Marlowe appears to find [[The New Army of Exploration]]'s triumvirate structure endlessly entertaining. She has been observed during council sessions taking visible amusement when [[NPCs/Surveyor-General Octavia Rhen|Surveyor-General Rhen]], [[NPCs/Court Magister Valerian Kade|Court Magister Kade]], and [[NPCs/Ambassador-Envoy Cassius Orell|Ambassador-Envoy Orell]] contradict each other, sometimes making side bets with [[NPCs/Flotilla/The Red Wake/Bastian Vale|Bastian Vale]] about which Taldan leader will undercut the others first.

More practically, she has been hired by all three Taldan leaders on separate occasions for various services navigational consultation, discrete transportation of artifacts, and even what appeared to be surveillance of the other Taldan leaders. Each leader seems to believe they're hiring her without the others knowing, a misconception Marlowe shows no interest in correcting. The fact that she's being paid three times by the same faction for overlapping services strikes her as particularly good business.

When asked about the arrangement, she allegedly remarked: "Why would I tell them? Watching Taldor negotiate with itself is the best entertainment this flotilla offers, and they're paying me for the privilege."
