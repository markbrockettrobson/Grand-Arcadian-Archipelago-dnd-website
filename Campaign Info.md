## Campaign Premise

The Arcadian Archipelago is a vast chain of tropical islands located in the distant reaches of the known world. These islands are rumored to be the remnants of an ancient civilization that wielded powerful magic.

For years, the archipelago has gradually shifted from impossibly distant to tantalizingly reachable a transition that has not gone unnoticed by the nations of the Inner Sea. Six months ago, [[The Hands of the Everlight]], a sect of Sarenrae's faithful, received a collective vision of a terrible plague spreading through the Archipelago. Their passionate advocacy and moral pressure assembled a massive international flotilla but what began as a mercy mission has become a complex political endeavor, as nations seized upon the crisis as justification for territorial ambitions long brewing beneath the surface. (See [[World Lore/The Opening of the Archipelago]] for the full geopolitical context.)_

[[The Assembly of Accord]], representing Absalom's elite and led by the formidable [[Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]], saw an opportunity to establish new frameworks for international cooperation. Their insistence on proper procedure and comprehensive charters delayed the expedition by five months, creating bitter resentment from the healers who see every day of delay as lives lost.

Now the fleet has finally set sail, carrying not just supplies and healers, but the competing agendas of a dozen nations, the simmering tensions between moral urgency and diplomatic procedure, and the seeds of conflicts yet to come.
