## Campaign Premise

The Arcadian Archipelago is a vast chain of tropical islands located in the distant reaches of the known world. These islands are rumored to be the remnants of an ancient civilization that wielded powerful magic.

For years, the archipelago has gradually shifted from impossibly distant to tantalizingly reachable a transition that has not gone unnoticed by the nations of the Inner Sea. Six months ago, [[The Hands of the Everlight]], a sect of Sarenrae's faithful, received a collective vision of a terrible plague spreading through the Archipelago. Their passionate advocacy and moral pressure assembled a massive international flotilla but what began as a mercy mission has become a complex political endeavor, as nations seized upon the crisis as justification for territorial ambitions long brewing beneath the surface. (See [[World Lore/The Opening of the Archipelago]] for the full geopolitical context.)_

[[The Assembly of Accord]], representing Absalom's elite and led by the formidable [[NPCs/Flotilla/Assembly of Accord/Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss|Lord Arbitrator Hadrian Voss]], saw an opportunity to establish new frameworks for international cooperation. Their insistence on proper procedure and comprehensive charters delayed the expedition by five months, creating bitter resentment from the healers who see every day of delay as lives lost.

Now the fleet has finally set sail, carrying not just supplies and healers, but the competing agendas of a dozen nations, the simmering tensions between moral urgency and diplomatic procedure, and the seeds of conflicts yet to come.

## Ancestries & Technology

### Allowed Ancestries

The campaign aims to keep a semi-serious tone. It is genuinely difficult to build a believable world with consistent NPC reactions when the party includes something like a living loaf of bread wielding Mage Hand — so please bear that in mind when choosing your ancestry.

| Rarity | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Common** | ✅ Allowed |
| **Uncommon** | ✅ Allowed (no prior approval needed) |
| **Rare — Undead** | ❌ Not allowed |
| **Rare — Construct** | ❌ Not allowed |
| **Other Rare** | Talk to the GM |

### Technology & Sci-Fi

This is a fantasy campaign — **no sci-fi technology**. Specifically:

- **No laser guns, energy weapons, or futuristic equipment.**
- **Early firearms only** (flintlock-era). Reskins are available if you want a different aesthetic — just ask.
- **Android** ([Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=27)): the mechanics are interesting but the aesthetic doesn't fit. If you like what Android does mechanically, bring it up and we can work out a reskin together.
