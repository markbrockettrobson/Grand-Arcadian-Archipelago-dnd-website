## Context for AI Assistance

When providing assistance in this repository:

### 1. Game System Knowledge
- This campaign uses **Pathfinder 2nd Edition** rules
- Reference PF2e mechanics, not D&D 5e or other systems
- Understand PF2e terminology: ancestries (not races), three-action economy, degrees of success, etc.
- XP and encounter building follows PF2e guidelines
- Familiarity with Archives of Nethys as the official reference

### 2. Obsidian Markdown Format
- Files use Obsidian-flavored markdown
- Wiki-style links: `[[Page Name]]` or `[[Folder/Page Name]]`
- Links to specific sections: `[[Page Name#Section]]`
- Follow the existing linking structure
- Maintain consistent formatting across similar document types

### 3. Campaign Structure
The vault is organized as follows:
- **Home.md** - Campaign homepage with quick links
- **Campaign Info.md** - Meta information and house rules
- **Party Roster/** - Player character overview
- **Session Notes/** - Session recaps and planning
- **NPCs/** - Non-player character profiles
- **Locations/** - Places in the game world
- **Quests/** - Quest tracking and details
- **Items & Loot.md** - Treasure and equipment
- **World Lore/**** - Setting information
- **DM Notes.md** - Game master secrets

### 4. Content Guidelines & Perspective

**CRITICAL: Player Knowledge Perspective**

All content in non-encrypted files should be written from the **player's perspective** - what the characters would observe, hear, or reasonably deduce through play. This is a player-facing vault, not a GM's secret notes.

**Write from player knowledge:**
- What characters can observe directly (appearance, public behavior, visible actions)
- What they hear through rumors, public statements, or conversation
- What they can reasonably infer from patterns of behavior
- Theories and speculation (clearly marked as such, e.g., "Many suspect...", "It appears that...")
- Information learned through investigation or interaction

**Do NOT write:**
- Hidden motives presented as fact
- Secret plans characters haven't discovered
- Internal thoughts of NPCs
- Definitive statements about unknowable truths
- GM-only strategic information

**Instead of:** "The Chelish joined to control the flotilla."  
**Write:** "Many suspect the Chelish joined to assert control over the flotilla's decisions."

**Instead of:** "Lord Voss secretly resents the delays he created."  
**Write:** "Lord Voss appears frustrated when factions exploit his procedural frameworks."

**For true secrets:**
- Use encrypted `.mdenc` files (e.g., `NPC Secrets.mdenc`, `GM TODO.mdenc`)
- Or create clearly marked `## GM Notes` or `## Secrets` sections at the end of files
- These sections can use omniscient perspective for GM reference

### 5. Pathfinder 2e Specific Assistance

When helping with PF2e content:
- Use proper action economy notation (◆ Action 
◇ Free action, ↩ Reaction)

### 6. Linking Best Practices
- Always create bidirectional links where appropriate
- Link NPCs to their locations, factions,
- Link quests to quest givers, locations, and sessions
- Link session notes to all relevant entities
- Use relative paths for links within the vault

## Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Use Pathfinder 2e rules and terminology
- Maintain Obsidian linking structure
- Keep player vs DM information separate
- Follow existing templates and formats
- Create rich, interconnected notes

**DON'T:**
- Use D&D 5e or other system mechanics
- Break existing link structures
- Mix player knowledge with DM secrets inappropriately
- Create content without proper linking
- Forget to update index pages
