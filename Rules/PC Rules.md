# PC Rules

## Rule Set

We will use the [Free Archetype](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2751) [Variant Rule](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2739).

> The only difference between a normal character and a free archetype character is that the character receives an extra class feat at 2nd level and every even level thereafter that they can use only for archetype feats. You might restrict the free feats to those of a single archetype each character in the group has (for a shared backstory), those of archetypes fitting a certain theme (such as only ones from magical archetypes in a game set in a magic school), or entirely unrestricted if you just want a higher-powered game.
>
> If the group all has the same archetype or draws from a limited list, you might want to ignore the free archetype's normal restriction of selecting a certain number of feats before taking a new archetype. That way a character can still pursue another archetype that also fits their character.

We are not limiting archetypes to a specific theme. You still need to meet all normal archetype feat prerequisites.

## Starting Level and Wealth

- **Starting Level:** 5th level
- **Starting Wealth:** 270 gp (standard for 5th level characters)
- **Starting Items level:** 5th level

consider that you will be on an expedition to a remote and dangerous location, so you should have equipment that reflects that. For example, you might want a tent

## Tone

The campaign will have a moderately serious tone. It is okay to have a good amount of whimsical and lighthearted elements, but the overall tone should be grounded and consistent.

It's hard to build a believable world with consistent NPC reactions when the party includes something like a living loaf of bread familiar. Please keep that in mind when making character choices, and if you have an unusual concept in mind, please discuss it with me.

## PC Motives

Each party member should have a clear motive for being on the expedition to the Archipelago. This could be a personal connection to the islands, a desire for adventure, a sense of duty, or any other reason that makes sense for your character. The key point is that it should be roleplayable and should help drive your character's actions and decisions.

Additionally, each character should have a reason the expedition would want them on the team. Whether it's a specific skill set, knowledge of the islands, or a unique perspective, there should be a clear reason why your character is part of this particular expedition.

Links to the major factions and geopolitical context are available in [[Factions/index|Factions of the Flotilla]] and [[World Lore/Campaign Overview|Campaign Overview]], and I encourage you to draw from those for inspiration when developing your character's motives. if you had an idea for a minor faction or organization that would be a good fit for your character, please let me know and we can work it into the world.

To this end, I want each character to have a connection to one of the major or minor factions. I want to build these ties into the story, so the sooner you share your character concept, the better I can weave it into the narrative. Aim for a connection that still lets your character keep their own agency and make their own choices.

This campaign isolates the characters from their previous lives and connections, so we have more freedom to include a character with a position of nobility without it being a problem for the party.

### Party cohesion

You can be trusted, but here it is for completeness' sake:

- **No truly evil alignments.** You can have selfish or morally ambiguous characters, but not ones that would make it difficult for a good character to justify being in the same party with them.
- **Chaotic alignments are allowed, but should be used thoughtfully.** If you want to play a chaotic character, please keep the tone and act in the best interest of the party and the overall story.
- **No axiomatic views.** Don't make a PC who refuses to be seen with a party member of a different alignment, etc. For example, a character who follows the [Laws of Mortality](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Laws_of_Mortality) and refuses to be seen with a character who uses divine magic or worships a god. This is not to say you can't have a character with strong beliefs, but they should be flexible enough to allow for party cohesion and consistent NPC reactions.

## Pathfinder Restricted Options

- **No Pathfinder Restricted options.**

## Ancestries

| Rarity        | Status                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Common**    | ✅ Allowed                            |
| **Uncommon**  | ✅ Allowed (no prior approval needed) |
| **Undead**    | ❌ Not allowed                        |
| **Construct** | ❌ Not allowed                        |
| **Rare**      | Talk to the GM                        |

For heritages and adopted ancestries, the same guidelines apply if the base ancestry is allowed, then the heritage or adopted ancestry is also allowed, unless it falls into a restricted category (e.g., undead or construct). Please feel free to discuss it with me.

Try to avoid exotic combinations of ancestries and heritages that stretch believability, for example, a Sylph lizardfolk adopted by Centaur parents. The more unusual the combination, the more it will require careful handling in play to maintain immersion and consistency in NPC reactions. If you have a unique concept that you think could work, please discuss it with me so we can find a way to make it fit within the campaign's world. I would much prefer we create a narrative that makes more sense and reskin the mechanics to fit, rather than trying to shoehorn a concept that doesn't quite fit a moderately serious tone and setting.

## Allowed Classes & Archetypes

### Classes

- **All classes are allowed**, including **Exemplar**.
- For Exemplar specifically: please keep the "fragment of a god" element low-key in play and tone.

### Archetypes

- **All Common archetypes are allowed.**
- **No undead archetypes:** Ghost, Ghoul, Lich, Mummy, Zombie, Vampire, Necrologist, Undead Master, Clockwork Reanimator.
- **No Exemplar archetype.**
- **No Rare archetypes without prior GM approval.**

## Technology & Sci-Fi

This is a fantasy campaign — **no sci-fi technology**. Specifically:

- **No laser guns, energy weapons, or futuristic equipment.**
- **Early firearms only** (flintlock-era). Reskins are available if you want a different aesthetic — just ask.
- **Android** ([Archives of Nethys](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=27)): the mechanics are interesting but the aesthetic doesn't fit. If you like what Android does mechanically, bring it up and we can work out a reskin together.

## Retraining and Character Changes

- **Retraining is allowed**, but downtime is very limited. You can expect 1-2 opportunities for retraining per arc, but you probably will not have weeks to do a major overhaul of your character, so keep that in mind when making character choices.

## Skills

I encourage you to have good skill coverage across the party. Please make sure you can check off the following:

- [ ] Everyone has at least some ability to swim (trained in Acrobatics is a good minimum).
- [ ] The party has at least one character who can craft magic items.
- [ ] The party has at least one character who can pilot or navigate a ship. See [Sailing Ship](https://2e.aonprd.com/Vehicles.aspx?ID=79) and [Raft](https://2e.aonprd.com/Vehicles.aspx?ID=77) for examples of required skills. You can probably get an NPC to help, but they will not be as good as a trained PC.

## Items

Common items are allowed. Uncommon and rare items require prior approval.

I know this can feel restrictive, but it keeps review workload manageable and helps maintain balance and tone.

If you have a specific item in mind, bring it to me and we can discuss whether it fits your character and the campaign.

# Spells

All common spells are allowed. Uncommon and rare spells require prior approval.

Teleportation and planar travel magic exist in this world, but a known magical phenomenon affects the Archipelago. Teleportation causes slight physical scattering. At very short ranges (including typical in-combat teleportation), characters may feel briefly disoriented but suffer no lasting harm. At longer ranges, teleportation becomes lethally unsafe.

This phenomenon is widely known and is one of the main reasons teleportation is not used to reach the Archipelago. It also means teleportation is not a reliable method of travel within the islands.

Long-range communication spells are similarly disrupted. Communication with people outside the Archipelago is not reliable through magical long-distance messaging.

See [[World Lore/Arcadian Interference Phenomenon|Arcadian Interference Phenomenon]] for the player-facing lore summary.
