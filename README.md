This site is configured to use [giscus](https://giscus.app/) for per-page comments.

1. Enable **Discussions** in this GitHub repository (`Settings -> General -> Features -> Discussions`).
2. Create or use a Discussion category (for example: `General`).
3. Open [giscus.app](https://giscus.app/), select this repository and category, then copy the generated `Category ID`.
