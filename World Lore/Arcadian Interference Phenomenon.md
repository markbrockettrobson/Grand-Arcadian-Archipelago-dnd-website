# Arcadian Interference Phenomenon

Throughout the flotilla and among experienced explorers, there are consistent reports of a magical interference effect tied to the Arcadian Archipelago.

## Teleportation Effects

Teleportation and planar travel magic are known to behave unpredictably in and around the Archipelago.

- **Very short-range jumps** (including typical in-combat teleportation) are generally survivable, though users may experience brief disorientation. (no mechanical penalties, but roleplay opportunities for confusion or minor mishaps)
- **Long-range teleportation** is considered lethally unsafe.

This is widely believed to be one of the main reasons nations have not used teleportation as a reliable way to enter the Archipelago.

## Communication Effects

Long-range magical communication is also disrupted.

- Communication with contacts **outside** the Archipelago is unreliable.
- Local communication may still work at shorter ranges, depending on spell and distance.

Most crews treat this as established operating knowledge and plan accordingly.
